Don&#8217;t worry, I didn&#8217;t disappear anywhere. I was busy most of this week planning and building my latest and greatest PC, and I am really proud of this one.

<a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.adir1.com//uploads/2007/09/msi-temperature-console.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="220" alt="MSI Temperature console" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.adir1.com//uploads/2007/09/msi-temperature-console-thumb.jpg?resize=244%2C220" width="244" align="right" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I built it from the finest cost-effective components. From <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115017" target="_blank">Q6600, the Quad Core</a> that is really reasonably priced and delivers awesome performance, to <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813130081R" target="_blank">MSI P6N SLI Platinum</a> and <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820227198" target="_blank">2 GB SLI memory by OCZ</a>. Everything started with <a href="http://www.woot.com/Blog/BlogEntry.aspx?BlogEntryId=2907" target="_blank">woot! deal</a> over last weekend, which I couldn&#8217;t resist since I&#8217;ve been contemplating finally upgrading that 2Ghz AMD64 that I had. I also got one <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814127284" target="_blank">nVidia 8600GTS OC card by MSI</a>, though it probably works better when there&#8217;s two of them. I plan to add second one once it&#8217;s cheap enough ($50 or so).

It&#8217;s all humming along nicely under the table now, and I can finally put my money (and such) where my mouth is and use Vista on my main PC. So far it&#8217;s been excellent experience, but I&#8217;ll keep you posted with unbiased opinion, I promise!

But, where is the promised jealousy, you ask? 

[<img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="115" alt="Alienware_MJ-12_Mid-Tower" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.adir1.com//uploads/2007/09/alienware-mj-12-mid-tower-thumb.jpg?resize=145%2C115" width="145" align="left" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]Here is a real life computer jealousy story! After I removed my old 2Ghz AMD64, which I promised to my daughter, I plugged it into power to download some files off of the old drive. What followed was a loud Boom sound, and a burnt smell. This PC worked for years just fine!!! What gives?! I suspect that power supply died, for unknown reason. And now my files are trapped in there, but maybe I will stop being lazy and extract the hard-drives and use one of my enclosures to liberate my important files from there, like E-mail&#8230;

Meanwhile, I overclocked this new Alienware bad-boy as you can see, and it&#8217;s finally fast enough to keep up with me. At least, for now!

And what is your wife&#8217;s main computer ?

My wife&#8217;s main is Pentium 4 at 2.4Ghz I think, it&#8217;s a Dell, and it&#8217;s quiet, and thus she likes it. Although it is pretty slow by today&#8217;s standards, even just for browsing eBay&#8230;
