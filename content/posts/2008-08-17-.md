  I have recently become yet another victim of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_Theft" target="_blank">Identity Theft</a>. It sounds very scary, but thus far in my case "all it was" is someone managed to purchase Delta flight tickets using one of my credit cards.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Now, the card was in my possession at all times, and yes, of course I use it around town. I had this card for a number of years, so it the number could have been obtained at any time during any of those earlier transactions. And of course I am very careful about who I give out my personal information to, and we consistently shred everything.

  I also always monitor all my transactions, in fact I check them at least weekly. This is something that Microsoft Money enables with ease, as it automatically connects to all my credit card companies (and banks), and shows me all the new transactions. I prefer this method, as memory of the transaction is still fresh in my head, and I immediately spot if something is not "Kosher".

  This particular event happened some time ago, and I spotted the transactions 3 days after the occurrence. It was Delta airplane tickets, where a person purchased a flight by phone for flying On The Same Day!
</p>

  And how stupid should a Perp be, to board the plane, having paid with stolen card! Delta assured me that they get the "real card owner" on the phone to confirm activity, if name on the card and passenger name doesn&#8217;t match. Only they have No WAY of checking who is that person on the phone, but still, it took potentially 2 collaborators to perform this particular crime.

Thus, most likely passenger name is real!

  Well, for me it sure wasn&#8217;t fun either! I spent half a day on the phone with my credit card company and with Delta. And tons more time on the Internet with <a href="http://www.annualcreditreport.com/" target="_blank">AnnualCreditReport.com</a>, the official source for obtaining free annual credit report from all 3 agencies, where I checked every account and every line, just to be sure.
