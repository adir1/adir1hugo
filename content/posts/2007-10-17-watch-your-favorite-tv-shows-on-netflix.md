  <a href="http://www.netflix.com" target="_blank">Netflix</a> quietly rolled out yet another wonderful feature! By now most of you have heard about Watch Now feature on Netflix, which allows you to watch up to your monthly dollar amount of hours of Movies "On-Demand" over the Internet. For example, if your subscription is $18 per month, you get 18 hours of Watch Now viewing for anything you can find in their, still limited, online library of movies.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  But in a very exciting twist, Netlix now allows you to catch up on popular TV series via the same Watch Now feature! Have you heard all the buzz about <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/" target="_blank">Heros</a>? I have! And I am the first to admit that I haven&#8217;t watched a single episode, although this show is in its second season, I believe.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  So, instead of renting DVD after DVD of past seasons, simply navigate to proper <a href="http://www.netflix.com/WatchNowMovie?movieid=70057024&trkid=203081" target="_blank">Netflix Watch Now</a> page, click Play and enjoy! Of course it still doesn&#8217;t work on airplanes or in other such places without Internet connection. Obviously, you will also need an active Netflix account (if you don&#8217;t, check out <a href="http://www.adir1.com/2007/10/new-ways-to-love-your-prime-time-tv/">my earlier post</a> for other TV catchup ideas). Plus your common 18 hours a month may not suffice to catch up fast enough, but no-one is preventing you from renting Season 2 on DVD while watching Season 1 streaming.

  Did I mention there are No Commercial Interruptions, as of course you would expect from a DVD watching experience. <a href="http://www.netflix.com/WatchNowMovie?movieid=70057024&trkid=203081" target="_blank">Heroes Season 1</a>, <a href="http://www.netflix.com/WatchNowMovie?movieid=70070300&trkid=174844" target="_blank">Heroes Season 2</a>, <a href="http://www.netflix.com/WatchNowMovie?movieid=70023522&trkid=203072" target="_blank">The Office Season 1</a>, <a href="http://www.netflix.com/WatchNowMovie?movieid=70044300&trkid=174844" target="_blank">2</a> and <a href="http://www.netflix.com/WatchNowMovie?movieid=70054868&trkid=174844" target="_blank">3</a> are just some of the examples I came upon. Or how about old Sci-Fi classics: <a href="http://www.netflix.com/WatchNowMovie?movieid=60036175&trkid=203080" target="_blank">Quantum Leap</a> or <a href="http://www.netflix.com/WatchNowMovie?movieid=70001488&trkid=174844" target="_blank">Sliders</a> ? Did you forget October is Halloween month, celebrate with <a href="http://www.netflix.com/WatchNowMovie?movieid=70038575&trkid=203080" target="_blank">Alfred Hitchcock Presents</a>, by watching in dark isolated space over your wireless network, in the middle of the night!

Ah, the long overdue Media Buffet is almost here!

  Remember, folks, You heard it here first! Now go tell your friends about it, and about where you read all about it, of course!

I just double checked Heroes and The Office, and there is entire seasons with all episodes available!  
For example, do a search on The Office Season 1, and click on the title in the results. It goes to the list of episodes for that season, and you can watch any of them.  
If you accidentaly end up in Movie Viewer before choosing an episode, click on Back To Browsing button at the bottom.  
Which specific show were you talking about? Maybe it&#8217;s different and for some reason only has one right now?
