Time sure flies when you&#8217;re having fun, NOT! You know it&#8217;s all downhill from here, when I am opening with a Not joke. 

<p align="justify">
  I have been busy with silly things lately, and overall more agitated than usual, for some unknown reason. Unfortunately, that means less blog posts for you, dear readers. I have many topics I have been thinking of blogging about, and instead decided to let You choose. Simply post in the comments, if any of the subjects below are of interest to you, and I will blog about them sooner, rather than later. It will be motivational for me also!
</p>

  * RSS Readers Primer &#8211; What the Heck are those and why should one care?!
  * Wives versus Mistresses &#8211; Two very important jobs or is it one?
  * Dell&#8217;s Vostro Laptop &#8211; Our recent purchase which is waiting for review here
  * Personal Computing &#8211; What&#8217;s next for us? What&#8217;s next in innovation here!?
  * Wi Fi Networks &#8211; The skinny on troubleshooting and optimizing your wireless
  * Essence of Life &#8211; Enjoy Life, even if it kills you (eventually)?
  * Media Buffet &#8211; Coming to a monitor near you! Jump Ship Now!
  * To Mac or Not To Mac &#8211; That is the Question
  * Fresh Milk &#8211; But for how long? This spells doom for your local grocer?
  * FolderShare &#8211; The next big thing! Brought to you by Microsoft??
  * Behind the Scenes in Vista &#8211; Stability, Shmability, Performance, Shmeformance

Not too many choices, so choose wisely ðŸ˜‰ . And Yes, you are allowed to ask for more than one subject, or suggest another topic altogether.

Obviously there is a wrong order of topics. It should be : Wives versus Mistresses &#8230;; Essence of Life &#8211; Enjoy Life, even if it kills you (eventually)?; To Mac or Not To Mac &#8211; That is the Question -Sure MAC! the rest&#8230; you can keep the same. we are looking forward to get it ðŸ˜‰

I will be glad to hear your opinion on

Dellâ€™s Vostro Laptop (it looks very attractive on the paper &#8211; <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/products/category.aspx/vostronb?c=us&#038;cs=04&#038;l=en&#038;s=bsd" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.dell.com/content/products/category.aspx/vostronb?c=us&cs=04&l=en&s=bsd</a>  
)

To Mac or Not To Mac

Thanx
