Meet <a href="http://www.ezgear.com/ALL/ezvision_X4.html" target="_blank">ezGear ezVisionX4 Video iWear</a>, courtesy of BJ&#8217;s wholesale club. Yep, finally, all those science fiction movies we all saw as kids are coming true. TV and Movie theater, 60&#8243; Widescreen, built into your eye-wear. With stereophonic sound, and iPod Video compatibility, of course!

I want one! But, alas, still too expensive for the non-necesity fun gadget that it really is. But, if you got the cash, head over to your local <a href="http://www.bjs.com" target="_blank">BJ&#8217;s wholesale club</a> and get one. Better yet, get two and send me one ðŸ™‚

I wonder how safe they are for every day use, especially while driving ðŸ˜‰</p>

So, what is the price and when is your birthday, if at all ?  
You were about to turn 35 or not yet ?
