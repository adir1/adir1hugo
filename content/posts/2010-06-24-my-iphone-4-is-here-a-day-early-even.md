It is in the long process of synching with iTunes, and filling it up with Apps and Stuff.

  So, Not much to report yet, but you know now that I decided to lock myself in with Apple and AT&T again, for perhaps as much as two years. Yes, Android EVO 4G from Sprint was really tempting option and I even tried to have educated discussion about it on <a href="http://twitter.com/adir1/status/15754321337" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. But my big concern was battery life and with my heavy usage it most likely wouldn’t last a full day even…

  Versus advertised 10 hours video and Wi-Fi surfing on iPhone 4 with their custom CPU! And yea, there’s an App for almost anything, hard to resist that aspect also. And Gazillion games, many of which I paid for and now get to enjoy on two devices.

  The new packaging is small yet still impressive &#8211; see picture with Sprite for perspective.

  Stay tuned for actual usage reports!
