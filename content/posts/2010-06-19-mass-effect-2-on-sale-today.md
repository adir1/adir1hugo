  I <a href="http://www.adir1.com/2009/12/mass-effect-2-is-coming-amazing/" target="_blank">raved about Mass Effect 2</a> in the past, it’s a Movie gone Game, or Game gone Movie, either way makes for amazing Sci-Fi experience. I also love <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, with their sensible license allowing you to install the game you purchase on your PC and on your Laptop, and play on either one, depending on what you happen to be on at the time.

  If you are <strong>not</strong> reading this on <strong>June 19th</strong>, the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/24980/" target="_blank">sale offering this game for <strong>$23.95</strong></a> is likely gone, and so I am sorry.. But, I am sure with time price will come down to even lower level! Or just pony up the extra cash, it’s Worthy Investment (ahem…)!
