It&#8217;s yet another secret software from Microsoft (much like <a href="http://www.foldershare.com" target="_blank">FolderShare</a>) which is just so <strong>awesome</strong> that they never advertise it, anywhere. I have been using their 1.x version for about a year and it "simply works", which is the best compliment ever, in my book, especially for a little utility.

  As the name implies, it is a simple Synchronization tool. You give it two file folders, either on your local computer, or, more often, on two computers on your home network. Next, it simply runs making sure that the two folders are completely synchronized. That is, all their files, sub-directories and their files, are all exactly identical. Here are some of the great uses I have for it in my home:
</p>

  * <div align="justify">
      Backup tool! My Photos and My Music Collection directories are Synchronized to a backup folder on another computer, providing simple and effective backup.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      My Videos, such as cartoons for kids, are backup up and synchronized to kids PCs, so they can all enjoy it on their local PC.
    </div>

  * Synching of e-Magazines (such as <a href="http://www.gamerzines.com/" target="_blank">GamerZines</a>, or <a href="http://www.zinio.com/" target="_blank">Zinio</a>) with Laptop on the Go. 
  * <div align="justify">
      Synchronization of Online Game installations, such as World of Warcraft. This game frequently updates it&#8217;s client, and instead of re-downloading 300Mb patch to several PCs where we play this game, SyncToy simply Synchronizes only the modified files.
    </div>

<p align="justify">
  I am sure you can think of more uses! <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/prophoto/downloads/synctoybeta.aspx" target="_blank">Read about this major release</a>, or go forth directly to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=c26efa36-98e0-4ee9-a7c5-98d0592d8c52&DisplayLang=en" target="_blank">download this completely Free gem</a> from Microsoft Download Center.
</p>

And Yes, it works on Windows Vista as well as XP!

<p align="justify">
  <strong>PS</strong>: Writing about "Works as Advertised" made me think about Zune Client software. All its bugs keep messing up my music collection and my podcasts!!! Seriously why even develop a whole new media player!? Why not improve Windows Media Player and be done with it?!
