You really [should subscribe][1], to avoid unpleasant situation that <a href="http://www.cnn.com" target="_blank">CNN</a> ended up in. Today they finally discovered and broadcast a Video that my readers [saw a week ago][2].

adir1.com &#8212; Your best source for early and relevant news! Well, except for natural disasters, political debate and other such depressing things that I will avoid reporting on.

I am planning a bigger post on my whole philosophy of blogging, but meanwhile just to emphasize that I favor Quality way above Quantity here.
