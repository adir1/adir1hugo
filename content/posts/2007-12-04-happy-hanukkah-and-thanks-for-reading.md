Happy 2007 Hanukkah everyone! It starts tonight, actually I am cooking right now and decided to take a short break just to wish everyone All The Best!

I also came across this wonderful 30 seconds rendition of Hanukkah Song on YouTube. Great voice, I think you will enjoy it!

    Actually, I had a pretty bad day today, but being with family and posting on blog right now makes me feel much better. Kids have been waiting for their gifts, which are going to be cool games and movies, as usual. What&#8217;s the birthday wish of our soon to be 4 year old? Latest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B000R0SRNU/?tag=craftonia-20" target="_blank">Lego Star Wars: Complete Saga</a> edition for XBox 360! But of course he loves the actual Lego sets just as much, and the HotWheels and pretty much anything else they show on Nick and Disney channel TV Ads ðŸ™‚
