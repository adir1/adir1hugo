I hope you are checking out &#8216;Now Playing on My Netflix&#8217; rubric on the right sidebar of my web site. Last week a movie <a href="http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Death_at_a_Funeral/70058015" target="_blank">Death at a Funeral</a> was listed there, as it always shows the movies I have at home.

<p align="justify">
  That movie is Hilarious! British humor at it&#8217;s finest, we laughed to tears, virtually non stop. And yet, it manages to come through as serious portrayal of a funeral, and perhaps a reflection on our lives and the choices we make while we are here.

5 Starts and endorsement from us! And the Happiness formula holds: you laugh = get happier! </p>

  PS: I have made serious enhancements to another open source Now Playing on NetFlix widget, resulting in what you see on my site. I am planning to open source it back to <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress.org</a>, just haven&#8217;t gotten around to it. Meanwhile, if you want it, just post comments below and I&#8217;ll gladly email it to you.
