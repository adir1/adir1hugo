The title is all you need to know. The special price only at your local MicroCenter store and only for 3 days. Of you don&#8217;t have one, check local Costco. Or, I will have a link to Amazon, which promised to deliver on Oct 22, on here later today.  
Posting from my iPhone, so signing off now.

I know you&#8217;ve been &#8220;playing&#8221; with Windows 7 for a long time now, so, should I buy it for that price?  
Should I buy it at all?  
Won&#8217;t sales be limited to &#8220;1 copy per household&#8221;? ðŸ˜‰

Amazon.com offers 3 per household right now, so I am heading there to order my second copy.

If you can get it for $50, I think it&#8217;s a good idea to grab one at least. The offer is until July 11, after which it will be around $110 or so.

Well, then order 2 and we will share shipping :-).  
By the way, Windows 7 will also have different flavors, like &#8220;Basic&#8221; and etc. ?  
And which flavor you get for $50?  
If it is not the &#8220;Ultimate&#8221;, I might pass&#8230;
