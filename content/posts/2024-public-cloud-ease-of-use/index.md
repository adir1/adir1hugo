title: Public Cloud - A Huge Leap Forward (or is it?)
description: Public Cloud Ease of Use has been completely neglected and continues to get worse. We had such tremendous evolution of hosting tools over the years, with cPanel and more. And now cloud dashboards are overly complex instead.

## TLDR

Somehow we went backwards over the recent years with endless complexity of public cloud dashboards. Obviously public clouds are in direct competition and don't want you to be able to easily switch providers, but this way everybody loses! GCP was the first to try radical new ideas with GAE, but sadly that backfired because devs like the comforting and familiar. Today most clouds are VMs and Containers, but where is the standard? Where is the ease of use? Where is the marketplace?

## Introduction to Algorithmic Trading and Quants


## Notes
Focus on how we abandoned simplicity - we should have powerful features available, but hidden behind more advanced options. More wizards and screens for simple scenarios.
Market deployment should be more powerful - provisioning wise and explaining costs
Backup, scaling, security and networking are probably biggest complicating factors - especially that de-facto cloud assumes not to know anything about your existing resources and account
Review and mention: Terraform, OpenTofu, Pulumi, AWS CloudFormation, Ansible, Crossplane, Firefly.IO, Spacelift, Fly.io
Tease that something coming from my own ideas on this!

## OLD SAMPLE

I don't claim to have all the answers, these are hard problems that will take time to solve. For starters it is important that we understand our limitations when making decisions based on data. Last thing Netflix wants is disgruntled consumers - some get so emotionally invested that they may swear-off Netflix from young age!

1. Focus on continuously improving data collection, with real-world testing to confirm accuracy. All analysis is only as good as the input data it gets!
2. Don't be afraid of creative approaches to confirm assumptions. Actually ask in the app - would you like to remove this show from Continue Watching because you didn't like it?
3. Discovery is still a huge problem - find ways to show trailers even to non-Ads consumers. Offer bigger banners for new releases with some teasers. Be creative here - and ensure all analysis of popularity takes into account how "discoverable" and "promoted" this new content was in the first place! And why not have Netflix's own annual Awards show for original content - cheap enough to produce and viewers can quickly get a taste of "What's new and good" on the platform?
4. People get invested into seeing stories to conclusion - this is both Useful for content producers and a possible trap. One solution for expensive productions is to make a single-story movie (perhaps with underlying hints for a bigger "conspiracy"), and if successful make additional movies in the same Universe/Series.
5. Consider the cost from the get-go - I am sure productions get green-light based on some sort of statistical analysis for how many subscribers like similar content and thus potential viewers. But how accurate is this - if director isn't the same, or actors differ, it can have huge impact on seemingly similar script. And what about Potential subscribers - surely Netflix needs to entice people who look at the catalog today and say "nothing interesting for me here"...

In a recent Interview for Bloomberg, Netflix new co-CEOs made a bold statement that "[they never cancel a successful show](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/01/24/netflix-says-it-has-never-cancelled-a-successful-show/)". This statement quickly catapulted to the top of the news by itself, simply because most of Netflix subscribers vehemently disagree with it! In
