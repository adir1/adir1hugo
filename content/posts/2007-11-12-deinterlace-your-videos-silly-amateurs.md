I am all excited about the release of the newly redesigned Zune software and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware" target="_blank">firmware</a>, which is coming out tomorrow. So, I was thrilled to watch first videos from around the web showing the new Zune features and User Interface.

  But, what is with all the Amateurism?! Either use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_scan" target="_blank">Progressive-scan</a> video camera or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinterlace" target="_blank">DEINTERLACE</a> your VIDEOS (YES, I Am Screaming!)
</p>

<p align="justify">
  First, <a href="http://www.zunerama.com" target="_blank">Zunerama</a>, with their extensive <a href="http://www.zunerama.com/zune-2-user-interface.php" target="_blank">Zune 2 video coverage</a>. It seems to be most complete coverage, but I can&#8217;t watch it with all those interlacing artifacts?!
</p>

  And <a title="CNET TV Zune 2 Video Review" href="http://www.cnettv.com/9742-1_53-31412.html" target="_blank">CNET TV&#8217;s Zune 2</a> review video?! I really expected professionalism there. What happened, got some new hires?!
</p>

  Sorry, I just had to rant. Fix it, folks! If you need assistance with how to de-interlace and what is the difference between progressive scan video camera and old-fashioned interlaced camera, comment below or see my <a href="http://www.adir1.com/about/" target="_blank">About Me</a> page for my contact info.

  I guess the important part is that I am all excited about this Zune software overhaul and will install it as soon as it is available tomorrow and report my experiences soon!

IMHO, progressive is still the best for vids especially HD. ðŸ˜€
