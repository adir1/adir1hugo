## Overview (aka: TLDR)

As a continuation of my Programming Revolution series, today bring you one Major area where Humans Developers can Outsmart the AI. Though, I can still see where this can be very much a collaborative effort due to AI's ability to analyze vast amount of data and find common concepts and ideas.

## Abstraction and Configuration

Everything is a tradeoff in elapsed-time vs cost, consistency/accuracy of throughput and ultimately availability also. Real-time versus background processing is where we can start our analysis.
People also underestimate importance of edge computing, and privacy + offline compute implications.


## Technical Debt

I argue that almost ALL AI Generated code is Technical Debt by definition!

## Elephant in the Room

Overhead is painful, context switching, security, threads, co-routines, kernel/user-space and on and on

## Aspects - Both Declarative and Imperative

Inline-Functions, Stack, Thread Efficiency

## Multi-Tenant

Discuss the many benefits and the even bigger security risks - consider solutions in static code analysis, row-level security, other ideas?

## Language Adapters

Conversion between languages and standards is essential, but there are higher powers at work! 
DSL - Kotlin? Loops to Streams?
C++ Operator Overloading
Functional Scope + Stack

SIMD
eBPF
