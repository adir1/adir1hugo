Looks like it takes a good game for people to start talking Tablet PC again. And this game does appear to be good clean geeky fun! The game is called <a href="http://www.kloonigames.com/crayon/" target="_blank">Crayon Physics Deluxe</a>, but it is not ready just yet, apparently.

    I&#8217;ve also been thinking lately about the convergence of TV and Internet. We all knew for a long time that it&#8217;s coming, but beyond the technical "functional" difference in how the video signal reaches you, the viewer, there is a whole Paradigm shift also.

    What I am talking about is the same dilemma that you have today with vast ocean of Internet. How to choose what to read? and how much to read? Now you will have the same dilemma with your video content.

    I think this is why YouTube is so successful. It actually helps you figure out what to watch "next", after you viewed something of interest, it shows you similar videos and keeps you hooked. And then there&#8217;s the whole organizing of favorite videos which we all like to do, to be able to go back and watch them again later, or show your kids, where appropriate ðŸ˜‰ . Just food for thought right now, your comments and ideas are welcome!

YouTube also suggests a bunch&#8217;a xxx-rated stuff you shouldn&#8217;t watch (no matter what video you were watching before)..or, perhaps, itâ€™s just an odd reaction to Russian music ðŸ˜‰ &#8230;.someone needs to clean up the algorithm.)

Strange, that&#8217;s not what it recommended for me. Perhaps it knows You personally somehow ðŸ˜‰
