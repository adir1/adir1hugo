## Overview

Cloud Computing Offerings continue to explode, not a month goes by without yet another "exciting" new solution from one of the Hyperscalers. How does one make sense of this landscape?

GOAL: TEASE Merka.cloud without divulging the name yet!!

As an advocate for Cloud Computing since the 90's (I wrote my thesis on Java Cloud Agents), 

## Are we doing Cloud Wrong?

Everything is a tradeoff in elapsed-time vs cost, consistency/accuracy of throughput and ultimately availability also. Real-time versus background processing is where we can start our analysis.
People also underestimate importance of edge computing, and privacy + offline compute implications.


## Digital Ocean? Lightsail? App Engine?

Those of us old enough recall hosting 10+ complete websites, each with their own Dedicated Database, on a single Linux server perhaps with as little as 512 MB RAM. 
Serverless struggles since App-Engine days, because of paradigm shift.

## Content Content Content

Just like ye-old classic in Real-Estate of Location, Location, Location - The cloud is all about Content!

## Surprise Billing - Ultimate Boss

Undoubtedly everyone has experienced at one time or another the shock of unexpected high bill. This just instantly sours the relationship to the brand, often long term. The situation in corporate world is arguably worse as you also need to explain to your manager(s) what happened, going beyond emotional scarring and into "caused us to miss our financial targets" territory (or even loss of employment?).

Between reserved instances, spot-instances, and bugs in IaC or pipelines - this is a strong and constant possibility. And in cross-cloud environment there can also be major swing in networking charges as files gets replicated as needed for various scenarios.

## Finally Free Lunch?

Free Tier at major Cloud providers is really designed to reel you in, but also very hard to compare. Large cloud providers now have armies of marketing gurus and product gurus who spend their days on how to outshine the competition.

###### Old Samples ###### 

So why let machines trade stocks independently at all? Well, besides the fact it is realistically impossible to block, many argue it gives human traders certain liquidity.

My thesis here is that this is a false promise - most of the automated systems have endless amount of rules and safeguards, and often in a situation of real "run-on-market" they step back and refuse to counter-trade also! In other words - if an average Joe decides they don't like "company X" any more and want to sell their shares ASAP, most likely a LOT of other people decided the same thing and automated systems detected this "avalanche" and would decide: let's see how low it goes before considering buying again!

## The young "Flash Crash Trader"

An interesting sidebar is a story of a brilliant young trader in England who noticed how several automated systems react to a particular Limit Order (order visible on the Markets L2 order book, but not yet executed). Many systems interpreted it as a certain Sentiment and were triggered to Buy/Sell ahead of it - while in fact the trader was "bluffing", and kept adjusting or cancelling his order shortly thereafter. [Here is the writeup from BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-51265169) about him.

## AI or KISS (Keep it Simple *Silly*)?

So how does our enormous leap forward in AI affect these automated systems? Should we rush to regulate them before all our pensions are demolished by another "[Flash-Crash Trader Wiz Kid](https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-51265169)"?

My sense is that AI ultimately operates as our tool, as a sort of "faster assistant" for what human would have most likely done anyhow. In fact all the Quant funds have been revising their AI over the years, albeit sometimes after the trades, as a sort of HITL (Human-In-The-Loop) before the acronym gained popularity! A lot of market looks like self-fulfilling prophecies, especially around Technical Analysis patterns, which I also believe is a result of both human emotion actions and AI trained to recognize it amplify it via built-in expectations.

This topic is huge, so I'll relent for now - below is some further reading, if you are interested. I also promise a post with a deeper dive into algorithmic trading in the future. 

Meanwhile, I recommend you Buy and Hold companies you personally like in your day-to-day - arguably the easiest and the best strategy over the long term!
