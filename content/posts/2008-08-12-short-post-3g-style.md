This my first post from an iPhone 3G. I am practicing typing with both hands and it is working pretty well, surprisingly so!  
For small posts on the go this is awesome! Now, I wonder if I can add photo on this thing?  
Also, anyone knows good IM clients for iPhone?

The dark side got me&#8230;Or is it the light side?

Lol, certainly feels that way!  
I will be posting my dark-side experiences soon, just collecting my thoughts.
