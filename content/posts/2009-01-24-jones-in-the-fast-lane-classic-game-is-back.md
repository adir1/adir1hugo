Ecstatic! I have been looking for a knockoff or even this original classic game, for at least a year now, hoping to introduce my kids to it and have some fun playing together!
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This weekend I happen to visit the excellent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jones_in_the_Fast_Lane" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a> for this game, and noticed a link to a completely payable <a href="http://home.broadpark.no/~kboye/jones/jones.html" target="_blank">Flash Version</a> of this game!! Even has the original Music and Sound Effects, amazing!!!
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  What is this game, you ask? Itâ€™s a board-game style Game of Life simulator. You simply play week by week, figuring out how much of the weekâ€™s time to allocate for various activities. Choose between eating (dohh), relaxing at home, working, or learning in Hi-Tech U. Of course you need to manage your budget through all of this and decide when to buy shiny new TV, move to better housing or try to find a better job.

  Kids and I already played one big game, late into Friday! Silly computer won, but my youngest came in close second, and me 3rd (What!? I forgot how to play, Okay!). And today, I plan to have a big challenge match, at least one. Kids love it also, starting to realize that it isnâ€™t an easy game to master. Really fun for the whole family! There are enough surprises (winning lottery, getting robbed, getting fired, etc) to keep it interesting from match to match.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Of course, lots of credit goes out to Sierra! I really loved them and their games. So sad that they lost their way and disappeared into corporate jungle of America nowadays. Also, Kevin Boye, whoever you are, Thanks a Ton for porting this to flash!!!
</p>

Play it now, <a title="Jones In The Fast Lane" href="http://home.broadpark.no/~kboye/jones/jones.html" target="_blank">right here</a>!
