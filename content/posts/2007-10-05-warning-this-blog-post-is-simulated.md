Lately I felt that I have been posting way too much on Technology or plain fun stuff, and not at all enough on Meaning of Life, as the sub-title of my blog implies. I have been contemplating for a while to break this trend, and today, the opportunity just screamed out at me while driving to work.

You see, I was listening to <a href="http://escapepod.org/2007/09/20/ep124-save-me-plz/" target="_blank">Episode 124</a> of the ever excellent <a href="http://escapepod.org/" target="_blank">EscapePod</a>, which is by far my favorite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast" target="_blank">podcast</a>. It presents short science fiction stories each week, and each is profoundly thought provoking, while staying fun and fresh (and often sexy!). I highly recommend you subscribe to this podcast, and to your advantage, there are over 100 earlier episodes that you can try to catch up on!&#xA0; 

I won&#8217;t spoil the plot of Episode 124 for you, entitled <a href="http://escapepod.org/2007/09/20/ep124-save-me-plz/" target="_blank">Save Me Plz</a>, but instead lets switch to the promised topic of this post, which has risen to the news again lately: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_argument" target="_blank">Our Entire Universe is Simulated</a>.

In fact, there has recently been a mathematically calculated proof that there is probably a high probability <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/4531-10921_7-6769211.html" target="_blank">we are living in a simulation</a>. 

You can <a href="http://www.simulation-argument.com/" target="_blank">read more</a> on this fascination philosophical argument, but I just wanted to move on and say Yes, lets assume that we Are living in simulation.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFantasy-Best-Year-Rich-Horton%2Fdp%2F0809572516%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1191415737%26sr%3D1-6&tag=craftonia-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" target="_blank"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="260" alt="Best of Fantasy 2008 edition" src="/uploads/2007/10/best-of-fantasy-2008-edition.jpg?resize=260%2C260" width="260" align="left" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>So what? Should you live your life any differently? Is your behavior less or more important, even if there were conclusive proof that we are living inside someone&#8217;s little simulation tube? I think by definition our creators wouldn&#8217;t want to interfere (read: communicate) with us, so should we even try to reach them? But maybe we are already in constant communication, <a href="http://thesims.ea.com/" target="_blank">Sims style</a>, with the grand creators of our simulation. And these communications reach our subconscious and often tell us what we "want" to do next (though sometimes we don&#8217;t listen, naturally). The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabalah" target="_blank">Book of Kabbalah</a> also reaffirms this, by implying that our life here is a Dream, and our wants are given to us from "the source".

Speaking for myself, I wouldn&#8217;t change a thing! Ups and Downs of life are here to be enjoyed, and dare I say, **equally** enjoyed. Give this little sentence more thought, as you go off and play <a href="http://thesims2.ea.com/" target="_blank">Sims 2</a> or <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com" target="_blank">World Of Warcraft</a> (former: Girls favorite, latter: Boys favorite, but your results may vary!)

So Make Sure to Enjoy Life, with this Simulated Post that&#8217;s in it!
