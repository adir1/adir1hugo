  With that in mind, I finally set a plan in motion to upgrade my media center PC, which is connected to the our big-screen. It was deemed not powerful enough (Athlon XP 1800+ or something, not even X2‚Ä¶) to process full screen H.264 media, which most media is nowadays.

<p align="justify">
  One of key usage scenarios was obviously to wath NetFlix on-demand via this media PC.

  So, as soon as I purchase everything, and not even before I finish setting things up, NetFlix goes commando with the following news:

  Well, I did try full screen <a href="http://www.hulu.com" target="_blank">Hulu</a>, and it really looks nice, but mostly for their very limited library of 720p content. Installed <a href="http://www.vuze.com" target="_blank">Vuze</a> on it also, and putting up <a href="http://www.tvtonic.com/" target="_blank">TVTonic</a> next.

  Speaking of the upgrade, I ended up snatching a great deal, instead of upgrading my motherboard/cpu/memory, etc, as I was planning. It would have cost around $350, since I needed extra Vista Permium license for this setup, and that alone is $100. So I was happy when <a href="http://www.slickdeals.net" target="_blank">SlickDeals</a> put up a coupon on refurbished <a href="http://www.dell.com/outlet" target="_blank">Dell Outlet</a> deals last week. Snatched up Dell Inspirion 530 with Core 2 Quad and 4GB of RAM for around that much, and added my own ATSC (HD) Capture Card with <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130288" target="_blank">nVidia 8400 GS</a> for full screen HD monster. It easily runs at 1080p now, including all media I tried to play full screen thus far. Plus, box itself is Beautiful, in white and slick metal front panel, plus runs practically silent. I am a happy camper!

  Now, if only NetFlix would put out a Vista Media center plug-in, for easy and fast navigation of queues and instant playback, in HD, that would be awesome‚Ä¶ But I guess they are too busy developing all those custom interfaces, instead of attacking the obvious, easy target‚Ä¶
