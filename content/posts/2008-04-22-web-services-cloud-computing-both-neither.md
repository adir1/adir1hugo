  An important <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/04/22/ray-ozzie-to-google-stay-off-my-lawn/" target="_blank">announcement from Microsoft,</a> something called Mesh, is happening tonight at Midnight eastern time.

  I am into guessing game, <a href="http://www.adir1.com/2008/02/my-prediction-for-secret-microsoft-project/" target="_blank">again</a>, mostly because it is fun, but also because in a funny coincidence, I left a rather long rant at Yahoo&#8217;s own <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/" target="_blank">Jeremy Zawodny&#8217;s blog</a>. What started as a short comment, turned into longer and I think worthy read about future of operating environments for us all. Jeremy doesn&#8217;t post too much, which is exactly how I prefer it and thus he is on my &#8216;read-first&#8217; list. Check out my comment <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/010199.html#comment-40671" target="_blank">right here</a>.

  Back to the issue, I really think this one will be about cloud computing and web services, or cloud services, or whatever we want to call them services. And of course, their integration into applications and the OS, finally. Some applications already integrate nicely, such as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/features/details/photogallery.mspx" target="_blank">Windows Vista Photo Gallery</a>. And I hope they will finally take it to the next level.

  Speaking of Vista, and of Windows 7. I hear people continue to trash it, but seriously, why?! Yes, it is bloated. Yes, it is incompatible with a lot of <strong><u>old</u></strong> software and drivers. But, that was obvious (just to me?!) going into it! Only install Vista on newer core 2 duo and faster PCs with 2GB ram. That&#8217;s obvious! Next, do NOT install older software on it, wait for lazy/suicidal/incompetent 3rd party companies come out with updated software specifically targeted at Vista! Or, use Microsoft&#8217;s new built-in software. Yes, be like the rest of us and use the primitive Windows Movie Maker for your HD editing&#8230; What? Microsoft were nice and anti-trust friendly by not killing Adobe and Sony and others in this market, and coming out with their own Killer Video Editing program. And how do Adobe/Sony/etc repay them?! Where is Vista optimized version of our favorite video editing tools, a year and a half later? Almost here, I bet&#8230;

Probably by the time your read this, the announcement will be out. For some reason <a href="http://www.mesh.com" target="_blank">official Mesh site</a> is acting up (stress-testing was skipped, I bet). So instead, check out <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/04/22/ray-ozzie-delivers-with-live-mesh/" target="_blank">Scobleizer</a> commentary on this "breakthrough" technology.</p>
