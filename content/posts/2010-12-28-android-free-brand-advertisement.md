What is most interesting is that Google did Not pay for any of it, as far as I know! Majority were paid by Samsung, making sure everyone hears about their new <a href="http://galaxytab.samsungmobile.com/" target="_blank">Galaxy Tab</a>.

<p align="justify">
  Granted, it is very exciting piece of technology and first <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/" target="_blank">iPad</a> competitor that can even remotely be put into the same category, but what struck me the most is all that Free Advertisement that <a href="http://www.android.com/branding.html" target="_blank">Google’s Android Brand</a> is getting! Most Galaxy Tab billboards emphasized Android PC in big letters, putting their own Galaxy Tab name in smaller print!

  In a way this is the magic of Open-Source software. Not only companies collaborate on Open infrastructure, but they can also collaborate on Brand marketing! Making Android OS brand recognition mainstream everybody ultimately wins. Seems that all companies have only upside in pushing Android, since such OS recognition elevates all boats, as they say. As more consumers think of it as viable alternative to Apple’s iOS, they will buy more and more Android devices. True, many will not be by Samsung at all, but some will be and as the Android Pie grows, so will Samsung’s slice and everyone else’s slice of it.

  Looks like I am not the only one who thinks that bigger <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/12/22/2011-will-be-the-year-android-explodes/" target="_blank">Android tide</a> is coming. Ironically, this makes me question my recent investment in a MacBook Pro for iOS development. Of course I was easily able to setup Android development environment on it as well. Now, all I need is time &#8211; to master development for both platforms and start churning out life-changing software.

  Or better yet, I simply need to create an Open-Source piece of Software and register it as a Trademark. Then just sit back and enjoy free advertisement others will buy for me, Right?

Hey Adi,  
I have A not relative question  
i&#8217;m using &#8220;Eclipse&#8221; to program in java  
and as a newbe i don&#8217;t always know the syntex problem  
in the code, and the compiler doesn&#8217;t always say what is the  
right soultion to the problem in the script

My Question is this:  
do you know an other free java compiler program that i can use  
to program in java, that is better then &#8220;Eclipse&#8221;.  
if you have any suggestion i would be happy to hear.

A lot of Thanks,  
Yaniv R.

Well, in my opinion, Eclipse is the best there is. Lately, some have said that IntelliJ maybe better, but I guess it is a matter of taste.  
The free Community Edition of IntelliJ can be found here, so feel free to give it a try and decide for yourself:
