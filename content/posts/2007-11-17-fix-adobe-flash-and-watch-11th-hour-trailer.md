  I am continuing to encounter strange Adobe Flash problems in Internet Explorer 7. We have a bunch of PCs here at home, and after upgrade to IE7 several had broken Flash. I had to search all other the web and try many different things before fixing it.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Few days ago I noticed that Adobe Flash stopped working on my main Windows Vista PC also, probably after Zune software installation, since that&#8217;s the only thing I installed recently. Though, there were also several Vista patches on Tuesday, that may have played a part in this.
</p>

I was able to fix it and here are the tips for you to try, organized from simple to hard:

  * Go directly to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash&promoid=BIOW" target="_blank">Adobe installation site for Flash</a>, Pay Attention and **Uncheck Google Toolbar** (seriously, it&#8217;s like Spyware installer!). Follow installation steps and make sure to reboot your PC after installation.
  * <div align="justify">
      Still doesn&#8217;t work? Try downloading <a href="http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=tn_19166&sliceId=2" target="_blank">Flash Installer package from Adobe</a>. Follow directions and download the Installer package at the end of step 3. HOWEVER, on Vista, do an extra step and Shut Down Internet Explorer + Find IEUSER.EXE in Task Manager and End Process on it. Then proceed to install Flash as downloaded above
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      Still broken? You are in serious fix&#8230; You will need to install Microsoft software and <a href="http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=fb1634cb&sliceId=1" target="_blank">fix some registry keys</a>. Then try again the step above. Reboot and Voila.
    </div>

<p align="justify">
  Of course, if you still can&#8217;t fix it, just use <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/" target="_blank">Firefox browser</a>, it seems to work just fine even while IE keeps insisting that "Flash not installed".
</p>

  Now that you have your Flash fixed, you have some options. First, educate yourself on our planetary crisis by watching the trailer below. Next, proceed to enjoy <a href="http://www.adobe.com/flashon/?promoid=BLROI" target="_blank">more Flash</a> capabilities and features, courtesy of Adobe. Of course if they would get their act together, and talk in over with Microsoft or whoever, you wouldn&#8217;t have to mess with all that Adobe Flash installation mess to begin with. <a href="http://www.adobe.com/flashon/?promoid=BLROI" target="_blank">Enjoy</a>!
