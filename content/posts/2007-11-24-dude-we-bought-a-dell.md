It&#8217;s a top notch Vista Laptop, from Dell&#8217;s Vostro <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/products/features.aspx/hot_offers_nb?c=us&cs=04&l=en&s=bsd&dgc=BF&cid=20243&lid=507237" target="_blank">Small Business Line</a>. Naturally, I am typing this mini-review on it right now.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  We have been using our Vostro 1400 since the beginning of September, which, albeit not much, is still more than some other people reviewing things out there (yes, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI73MA?ie=UTF8&tag=craftonia-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000FI73MA" target="_blank">Amazon Kindle</a> reviewers, I am looking at you!!).
</p>

<p align="justify">
  I must say I had high expectations for this laptop, mostly since CPU and motherboard technology has come such a long way lately. This year Intel finally got their act together and introduced low power / high speed CPU line, which is a real necessity for having a decent mobile machine.
</p>

I am not into lengthy reviews, and I think my readers aren&#8217;t either, so here&#8217;s the summary of what I think are most critical points:

  * <div align="justify">
      Cool looks, but most importantly runs Cool also! The thing does not heat up! Unless you are doing some intense gaming, the fan doesn&#8217;t run, or runs at very low speed. I can finally keep it comfortably on my lap without getting burned!
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      Integrated 2 Megapixel webcam, microphone, WiFi, and other small touches are great and really add to overall appeal (click on picture above for details).
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      The 14" model that we got is pretty light; without extended battery it is only 5.3 pounds, not ultra lightweight, but reasonable indeed.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      Long battery life, advertised at <u>7 hours</u> with extended battery, though we haven&#8217;t had a chance to test it in the field yet.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      Power cable connector "snaps-out" if it&#8217;s pulled (or tripped over) accidentally. Now quite Apple&#8217;s magnetic connector, but still nice of Dell to finally put some engineering thought into the "little things".
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      Comes with free Integrated 10 GB Online backup. Dell is keeping it free for this year, and they told me they don&#8217;t know if it will change next year, or if they will ever charge for it.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      The laptop itself is inexpensive! Yes, that is a feature, for me at least!
    </div>

<p align="justify">
  I got it with Vista, naturally, and I think that&#8217;s the only way to go. Looks like they heard <a href="http://www.adir1.com/2007/08/dell-and-game-changing-idea-storm/" target="_blank">my plea</a> and added Vista Home Premium option also. Too bad we already got ours, but still Kudos to Dell for listening to their customers!
</p>

<p align="justify">
  If you are buying, make sure to opt-in for Vista Home Premium or higher. Make sure to add Integrated Web-Cam with Microphone. Also, we got ours with 2GB of RAM, and don&#8217;t you even think about going lower, though it&#8217;s pretty much standard these days anyhow.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  That&#8217;s all for my mini-review. Overall it&#8217;s a <u>great machine</u>, no problems to report thus far. Runs everything you can throw at it, including games in high-resolution, just make sure to add nVidia 8400 or higher, if you plan on gaming with it a lot.

What about more cool features? Like may be SD/MS/XD integrated card reader? And screen&#8230; Did you take the regular glossy one or the Vibrant/Crystal/TrueImage view?  
Don&#8217;t know how exactly Dell named that technology, but I&#8217;m sure you know what I mean&#8230;  
Yeah, and&#8230; Does your wife use her birthday present, or it became another laptop of yours? ðŸ˜‰

Yes, has integrated SD/XD and similar card reader. It&#8217;s on the front, so nicely placed also. Headphones output is also on the front, very nice!  
The screen is TrueImage (or Vibrant, whatever) on ours, but it&#8217;s $0 option either way on Vostro line.  
She uses it, but rarely. I was hopying it&#8217;d be her primary machine, dockable on her table, but she still against it, so only uses it while in front of TV mostly.
