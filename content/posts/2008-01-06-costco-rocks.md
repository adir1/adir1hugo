I want to apologize for light blogging this past week.

Without going into too much detail, I&#8217;ll just say that our Plasma TV of long had some troubles that could not be repaired. Thanks to <a href="http://www.costco.com/" target="_blank">Costco</a> and their Concierge Service, we now have brand new TV that everyone loves.

Now that this crisis is resolved, I promise to go back to regularly scheduled blogging!

My family is happy again, so here is one more time: Thanks <a href="http://www.costco.com/" target="_blank">Costco</a>!

Hi,  
What did &#8220;Concierge Service&#8221; do ?  
They brought, unpacked, installed, wired, tuned, etc.. your TV set ?

Concierge Service helped us replace our old TV with brand new one, for free.  
One of the main reasons I did not want to go into too much details is because their terms of service have changed. Luckily for us, we were under the old contract, which extends longer; the new Concierge service agreement runs for just 2 years now.  
Still, it&#8217;s great, and we are going to inquire whether we can pay to extend this service of theirs for longer period.

PS: No, they did not bring, install, wire, etc, our TV. I did all that myself. Though they offer that service also, for $89 as I recall&#8230;
