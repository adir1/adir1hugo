Sounds rather interesting, learning more about the tough and exciting world of Startups and Ventures.

  Mind you, I know exact name of podcast, and even the short version #twist. So I searched on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=this+week+in+startup&rls=com.microsoft:en-us&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&startIndex=&startPage=1&rlz=" target="_blank">Google</a> – Got Nothing. Next I tried <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Special:Search?search=this+week+in+startups+podcast&search-type=mahalo" target="_blank">Mahalo</a>, still nothing. <a href="http://delicious.com/search?p=twist+podcast" target="_blank">Delicious</a>? Nada! And don’t tell me iTunes, that’s not very useful, since I prefer not to overload my iPhone, and still use Zune for all my podcasts.

  So, who saves the day? <a href="http://twitter.com/JasonCalacanis" target="_blank">Twitter</a> of course! Sadly, for now only Video subscription is available. I’ll update this post as soon as direct <a href="http://thisweekinstartups.com/?feed=podcast">MP3 RSS feed</a> is published.
