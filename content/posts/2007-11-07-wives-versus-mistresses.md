  I guess I walked into this one, who knew that this would be such <a href="http://www.adir1.com/2007/11/a-very-important-post-about-nothing/" target="_blank">popular topic</a> on everyone&#8217;s mind ðŸ˜‰
</p>

<u>Disclaimer</u>: The discussion henceforth is purely theoretical in nature.

<p align="justify">
  I have been thinking lately about this whole Mistress as a concept. Especially after watching some good sexy yet mostly comic situations with mistresses in this new <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/dirtysexymoney/index" target="_blank">Dirty Sexy Money</a> show.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  The word itself, Mistress, is by definition a woman; also, according to <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/mistress" target="_blank">Merriam-Webster</a>, the word has been around since at least 14th century. Whatever your belief for human <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creationism" target="_blank">Creationism</a>, it seems to me that tiny miscalculation might have occurred. Once a woman takes on motherhood responsibility, especially with more than one child, there is rarely enough time or energy left for the significant other. Second part to this is the whole "managing the household", where traditionally women are expected to take care of the home, adding yet another huge layer to their overall busyness and ultimate exhaustion.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  On the other hand, the busy husband, though often tired as well (livelihood is hard!), appears to be Designed as a constant machine for sperm production! No monthly periods here, no yearly hiatuses, nothing!
</p>

<p align="justify">
  I am not aware of any Male equivalent to the word Mistress, though feel free to enlighten me here. Thus, it appears that for many centuries now, human race recognized a specific position, almost like job description, of <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/mistress" target="_blank"><strong>Mistress</strong></a><strong>&#xA0;</strong>&#8211; woman other than wife with whom a married man has a continuing sexual relationship.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  However, "miscalculation" in creationism (or maybe the ultimate correction?) continues here! By nature, Women are Emotional and Sensitive, so nothing "Casual" can work for more than a few times! And here&#8217;s ultimate trouble &#8212; if the two "jobs" are separate, then a woman will have to choose, whether to procreate or be a Mistress for a lifetime. Since, by our calculations above, if a woman ever stops being a mistress, and becomes a mother, than the position of mistress becomes available for the taking&#8230; (I am avoiding the whole reasons one may convince herself to be a mistress. Things such as Fun, Political/Business Influence, or ultimate attempt to "steal" a man, are usually delusions, and can only last for so long&#8230; )
</p>

<p align="justify">
  In conclusion, if we really consider the implications for both men and women, the only recourse is to consolidate these seemingly two separate jobs into one person. And here&#8217;s my personal tip for achieving success here:
</p>

<p align="justify">
  <strong>Guys</strong> &#8211; Remember that "managing household" and "motherhood" are only <u>traditionally</u> women job. Help balance this load and it&#8217;s a Win Win scenario for both of you!
</p>

<p align="justify">
  <strong>Gals</strong> &#8211; Remember that guys seem to be "built" this way by design; so remember to pay equal attention to <u>both</u> important jobs that you have in the relationship!
</p></p>

Good analysis and good recommendations. I think that if men rose above their biologically driven (primarily through testosterone) desire to have sex with as many women as possible, then men would have an easier time focusing on and helping the most important women in their lives: their wives. In the same way, if women could moderate their biologically driven (primarily through oxytocin) desire to bond with and raise children, then they would have an easier time meeting the sexual needs of their husbands.

Excellent comments, thanks!  
Good advice just keeps coming, if only it were that easy for all of us to change&#8230;
