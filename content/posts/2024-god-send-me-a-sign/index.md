## TLDR

We were stuck in traffic with my son the other day and I laughed at a funny outdoor sign. He asked what it was, and soon we realized that there is a large truck blocking his view of the sign. He pretty quickly demanded that I "destroy" that truck, and after I calmly explained why it is a wrong way of thinking - I started to reflect more on what the driver of that truck was thinking. He was stuck in the same traffic and certainly would be happy to get to his destination, sort of a potential win-win solution. Instead he was being berated for obstructing our view, something he had no way of knowing he was even doing!

## Duopoly of US Politics - Go Vote

Need more options! Still reflect on what are the topics most important to you when deciding, and most of all - avoid misinformation. It is especially easy to say "the candidate did not do X", or "candidate thinking of doing Y (presumably bad thing)" - these are intangible attacks that in 99% have no basis in reality. Focus on stated, documented goals - and when possible, evaluate whether same party (or same candidate if possible) achieve stated goals in the past.

## Solution Ideas

I don't claim to have all the answers, these are hard problems that will take time to solve. For starters it is important that we understand our limitations when making decisions based on data. Last thing Netflix wants is disgruntled consumers - some get so emotionally invested that they may swear-off Netflix from young age!

1. Focus on continuously improving data collection, with real-world testing to confirm accuracy. All analysis is only as good as the input data it gets!
2. Don't be afraid of creative approaches to confirm assumptions. Actually ask in the app - would you like to remove this show from Continue Watching because you didn't like it?
3. (New Show) Discovery is still a huge problem - find ways to show trailers even to non-Ads consumers. Offer bigger banners for new releases with some teasers. Be creative here - and ensure all analysis of popularity takes into account how "discoverable" and "promoted" this new content was in the first place! And why not have Netflix's own annual Awards show for original content - cheap enough to produce and viewers can quickly get a taste of "What's new and good" on the platform?
4. People get invested into seeing stories to conclusion - this is both Useful for content producers and a possible trap. One solution for expensive productions is to make a single-story movie (perhaps with underlying hints for a bigger "conspiracy"), and if successful make additional movies in the same Universe/Series. On a related note - Latest Neuroscience can help here, for example excellent book by Jonah Lehrer [How We Decide](https://www.amazon.com/How-We-Decide-Jonah-Lehrer/dp/0547247990?tag=craftonia-20).
5. Consider the cost from the get-go - I am sure productions get green-light based on some sort of statistical analysis for how many subscribers like similar content and thus potential viewers. But how accurate is this - if director isn't the same, or actors differ, it can have huge impact on seemingly similar script. And what about Potential subscribers - surely Netflix needs to entice people who look at the catalog today and say "nothing interesting for me here"...
