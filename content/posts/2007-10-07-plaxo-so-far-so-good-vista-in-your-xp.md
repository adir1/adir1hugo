  I signed up for <a href="http://www.plaxo.com" target="_blank">Plaxo</a> account today, following a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/05/plaxo-linkedin-iphone-brilliant/" target="_blank">little reminder</a> of their existence. I have been watching their progress for a while, and looks like they are on the right path and have stamina needed to survive rough startup waters. The core functionality that they were always about is maintaining a type of &#8216;self-updating&#8217; Address book on the web. It&#8217;s great, because even if your friends change phone numbers (new job, new home, new phone provider, etc.) The idea that if I update my phone number, it will automatically update address book of all my friends. This is something I have been waiting for a while. But I never wanted to work hard to migrate my address book into &#8216;yet another web site&#8217;, but their latest auto-sync with Yahoo! and Google features have finally convinced me.

<p align="justify">
  The sign up and Sync with Yahoo! and Outlook all went without a hitch. There were some duplicates, but I easily cleaned them in Outlook, and it auto re-synced everything soon thereafter. PLUS my <a href="http://msmobiles.com/news.php/4691.html" target="_blank">Windows Mobile phone</a> contacts are auto-synchronized with Outlook, resulting in a perfect Trifecta. Now, I can go online and update/add/lookup contacts. Use them in my Outlook when sending email, or calling them (or emailing) from my phone. And all with self-updating contact information! Wow, I just noticed that somehow my Skype got updated with all my contacts from Yahoo also, nirvana.

  In other news, in case you missed it in <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/18433100766597525188" target="_blank">my shared links</a>, here&#8217;s a little tip on how to get your <a href="http://www.mstalkonline.com/transform-xp-look-to-vista/" target="_blank">Windows XP to look like Vista</a>. This is just look and feel, mind you, and none of the fancy features (like <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2007/03/VistaKernel/" target="_blank">SuperFetch</a>). But you can also get the very handy quick-type style Start Menu via little free <a href="http://www.launchy.net/" target="_blank">Launchy</a> utility. With it, just start typing what you are trying to launch or find, and it finds it! Make sure to remember to click <strong>Ctrl-Space</strong> after starting it, otherwise it stays hidden.

  Finally, I leave you today with little video of Windows Vista Ultimate Dreamscape effects, augmented with some <a href="http://microsoftclick.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!1114F5166AE276CA!360.entry" target="_blank">good 3rd party views</a>. Notice that this is actual desktop background, on top of which you can run programs and other videos, good ones ðŸ˜‰
