<p align="justify">
  I decided to start the year off by putting together a little post to help all you good people out there make computing decisions for 2011.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  First thing you need to decide about <strong>2011</strong> is that <u>this</u> is the year is when you need to come out of hiding. I know many people are still scarred by major malware attacks and endless virus invasions of the past few years. This is especially true for those of you still out there using Windows XP and claiming that it is “perfectly fine” for your needs.

Exactly the reason you were afraid to Bank online, do your Taxes or key other sensitive information into your computer! Solution is simple – get a new Windows 7 based system or even a Mac. Both platforms are finally <strong>secure</strong>, which is key to your positive experience, in my humble opinion.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Windows 7 PCs are more affordable than ever, and getting a Laptop is really the best option this year. They are often as inexpensive as their bulky desktop counterparts. The big thing for desktops was always the 3D Gaming, but you can get that <a href="http://www.dell.com/us/p/alienware-m11x/pd?refid=alienware-m11x&~ck=mn" target="_blank">on many laptops</a> also nowadays. Microsoft also <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/" target="_blank">offers free antivirus</a>, so you don’t have to spend a second without protection. Be sure to get <strong>64 Bit</strong> version with at least <strong>4 GB</strong> of RAM, this will make your new PC even more secure and will seriously boost performance.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Mac already comes only as 64 Bit and I don’t believe they sell any 2 GB models now. Apple’s premium cost can possibly be justified by light and elegant hardware, still offering long battery life. You need to decide that this is important for you to spend that extra cash. Another plus is the excellent iLife software Mac comes with, for organizing Photos and editing Videos, among other things. On the flip side don’t let Anyone tell you that Mac is easier to use, you <u>will</u> have tough learning curve if you are used to Windows.

  But what about all the Pads, Tablets and other Mobile gadgets? Frankly, it all depends on your usage patterns! I increasingly find that iPhone 4 lets me do pretty much Everything (except type large blog posts like this one). I recently started using Chase App on my iPhone, which not only lets me pay all my bills right from the phone, but even <a href="https://www.chase.com/index.jsp?pg_name=ccpmapp/shared/assets/page/Chase_Mobile_Banking" target="_blank">Deposit Checks</a>! Yep, you simply take picture of check’s front and back and voila!!!

There are new (albeit still pricey) options – like this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B004HKIIFI/?tag=craftonia-20" target="_blank">Asus Eee Slate</a> with powerful i5 CPU and wireless keyboard, making it into a hybrid solution you are sure to enjoy. Or, the Android option, with hottest one today being <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/01/22/motorola-xoom-launching-february-17th-at-best-buy/" target="_blank">Motorola Xoom</a>, but <u>many</u> more options are coming very soon, from myriad of manufacturers, most of who we never heard of. The newly <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/01/06/googles-android-3-0-honeycomb-for-tablets-a-guided-tour-of-the/" target="_blank">refreshed Android UI</a> coming soon in version 3 looks really exciting and can finally offer iPad some competition.
