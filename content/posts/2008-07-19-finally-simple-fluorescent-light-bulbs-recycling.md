All of them contain Mercury, a very dangerous Cancer causing chemical, even in small quantities can be inhaled and cause all kinds of nasty things.

  Over the years I have been collecting the light bulbs, planning to drive to an official recycling center, but there wasn&#8217;t one anywhere near us! About half a year ago, while shopping in our local Home Depot, I noticed their employees carelessly dropping several large fluorescent tubes into big trash can at the end of the store. Needlessly say I wasn&#8217;t happy. I asked them about recycling, and the manager asked WHAT? WHY? She had no clue, so I called corporate number and explained my concern.
</p>

I probably wasn&#8217;t the first, and recently <a href="http://www6.homedepot.com/ecooptions/stage/pdf/cfl_recycle.pdf" target="_blank">Home Depot announced official Recycling Program</a>! I have collected quiet a lot of bulbs over the years (staring at the box full of about 20), so I am happy to finally get rid of them, in environmentally friendly way.

Oh, and I may stop by AT&T store, which is right next door, and pick up an <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone" target="_blank">iPhone 3G</a>. More on that later! And I am thinking of upgrading my blog this weekend to 2.6 <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a>, it&#8217;s about time. Ah, plans plans.

In other random happenings, I installed <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> 8.04 about a week ago, and I plan to post on that also, including super simple install instructions, soon.</p>

Regarding the iPhone &#8211; buy one on my behalf too ;-).  
Regarding Linux &#8211; why did you end up with Ubuntu, instead of Fedora?

Yeah, and of course thumbs up on Green thinking. I actually didn&#8217;t know that those bulbs are harmful&#8230;

Although Fedora did work at first, it boots up with message &#8220;Kernel failure occured during startup&#8221;. I didn&#8217;t like the sound of that&#8230;  
Plus I am used to Ubuntu, so decided to go back to that.

This should be National program! So if you have Home Depot there, they should accept the lamps for recycling.
