## Brief

Borders and Walls appear to be essential element of our society. We see them everywhere - in our homes, and yards and streets. We also encounter them on a bigger scale when crossing into other cities, or county lines, and especially with state/country borders. Yet my sense if few understand their symbolic significance and most importantly - what is the power dynamics around them. Here I attempt to reflect on this important concept, especially with their anthropological significance for our entire civilization - as an obstacle/solution to World Peace.

## History

Genghis Khan 

### Gemini 

**The Great Wall of China had a mixed impact on Genghis Khan's attack.**

**On one hand, the Great Wall served as a formidable obstacle.** It was a massive fortification, stretching thousands of miles and often equipped with watchtowers and garrisoned by soldiers. This made it difficult for the Mongols to bypass or overrun.

**However, the Great Wall also had its limitations.** It was not a continuous structure, and there were gaps and weaknesses that the Mongols could exploit. Additionally, the Mongols were skilled at siege warfare and had developed tactics to overcome fortified defenses.

**Ultimately, the Great Wall did not prevent Genghis Khan from conquering China.** While it slowed his progress and caused him losses, it was not insurmountable. The Mongols' superior military tactics, discipline, and determination allowed them to overcome the wall and ultimately establish their dominance in the region.

### ChatGPT

The **Great Wall of China** was not a direct reason for Genghis Khan’s invasion of China, but it did symbolize a broader set of circumstances that contributed to his motivation to attack the Chinese states. Several factors linked to the Wall, and the overall geopolitical situation in China, played into his decision-making. Here’s how the Great Wall and its context fit into the larger reasons for the invasion:

### 1. **Symbol of Wealth and Resources**
   The Great Wall represented a long history of wealth, power, and resources of the Chinese empires. Genghis Khan and the Mongols were aware of China’s vast riches, both in terms of land and material wealth. The Wall, though intended as a defensive structure, was a visible symbol of these resources. It may have reinforced Genghis Khan’s ambition to conquer and control the prosperous Chinese territories.

### 2. **Desire for Tribute and Trade**
   Genghis Khan initially sought to establish peaceful trade and tribute relationships with the Chinese dynasties, particularly the **Jin dynasty** that ruled northern China. The Wall was part of the defensive posture of these dynasties, often closing off opportunities for trade or diplomacy. The Wall, as a barrier, reflected China’s historical attempts to manage and control relations with nomadic peoples like the Mongols. When the Jin dynasty rebuffed or limited trade opportunities, it gave Genghis Khan further motivation to use force to achieve his aims.

### 3. **Perception of Insult and Resistance**
   Genghis Khan’s decision to invade was partly motivated by perceived insults and dismissive attitudes from Chinese rulers. The Wall, as a defensive fortification, might have symbolized the **Jin dynasty's** perceived superiority and their desire to separate themselves from the nomadic Mongols. This division may have fed into Genghis Khan's ambition to challenge their authority. When diplomacy failed and tribute demands were unmet, it fueled his desire for conquest.

### 4. **Strategic and Political Goals**
   The Wall also stood between the Mongols and their strategic objectives in China. Genghis Khan aimed to subjugate neighboring powers, expand his empire, and establish control over important trade routes. Since the Wall was designed to protect northern Chinese states like the Jin dynasty, conquering these territories became part of his grander strategy of empire-building. The Wall, in this sense, was an obstacle to his larger goal of uniting and controlling both the nomadic and settled societies of Asia.

### 5. **Mongol Tradition of Raiding**
   Nomadic groups like the Mongols had long engaged in raids against settled agricultural societies, and walls were often built to defend against such incursions. The Great Wall’s presence, while defensive in nature, could be seen as a challenge to the Mongols’ traditional raiding lifestyle. In many ways, it represented the ongoing tension between the nomads of the steppe and the sedentary societies of China.

### Conclusion:
While the Great Wall of China itself wasn’t the **direct** cause of Genghis Khan’s invasion, it embodied the barriers—both literal and figurative—that stood between the Mongols and the wealth, resources, and power of China. The Wall symbolized the Chinese empires’ desire to protect themselves from nomadic threats, but it also became a target for Mongol expansion. Genghis Khan’s invasion was driven by a combination of economic, political, and cultural factors, with the Wall representing the divide between the Mongol steppe and Chinese civilization. Thus, while not a primary cause, the Great Wall was part of the larger context of Genghis Khan’s motivations.

### Conclusion-Alt:

While the Great Wall of China was a significant defensive structure, its presence or absence would not have fundamentally changed Genghis Khan's desire to conquer China. His motivations were deeply rooted in economic opportunity, political fragmentation in China, and his ambition to build a vast Mongol Empire. The Wall was more of an obstacle than a cause for the invasion. Even without the Wall, the factors that drew Genghis Khan to China—wealth, power, and strategic dominance—would have remained, making an invasion almost inevitable.


## Anthropology

I'll admit - when I thought of the title, I wasn't aware there is a whole Degree named that:

## Conclusion

Ultimately the wall/border concept is undoubtedly very useful for any society. However of most important to understand is that the border doesn't solve anything per-se. In today's politics there are many people who "want secure borders", and to hell with the whole world burning outside.

the border itself provides no power - it is legal/military societal structures that give it power. For example - it is great to have a wall between apartments, however disputes around noise, wall disrepair, and more - all persist and often require higher authority/power to resolve.

Thus it is important to reflect on world stage as a cohesive organism of "dictatorships/democracies" and much more - to make for a safe planet. In other words - unilaterally sitting at home and "securing borders" will ultimately lead to much bigger wars and destruction down the line.
