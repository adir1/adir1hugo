<p align="justify">
  I am not into putting together "year end review" of 2007, like some other bloggers, and I especially don&#8217;t like all the posts on New Year Resolutions for 2008. One of the late lessons you learn in life is that when you Talk about doing something in the future, and you keep talking about it, chances are you will <u><strong>not</strong></u> do it. The more you discuss doing something (instead of actually going for it!), the more you realize that it probably isn&#8217;t all that great, or something could go wrong, or just loose interest in general&#8230;
</p>

<p align="justify">
  So instead of some empty resolutions, I took some affirmative action today, some first major steps, if you will, with more to follow:
</p>

  * <div align="justify">
      First, I am adding <a href="http://www.adir1.com/watch/">Watch</a> page to my blog. It&#8217;s right up there on the header, next to About Me and other pages. The idea is to aggregate some of my favorite videos in one categorized page. Right now it&#8217;s mostly videos I blogged about already, that I enjoy, but I will be adding some other fun videos as I come encounter them. Hopefully you will return to that page often (Bookmark it!) and I trust you will enjoy them as well.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      Second, I am announcing launch of another blog called <a title="EconoVille.com - Your New Source to Understanding Economics" href="http://www.econoville.com" target="_blank">EconoVille</a> that I will moderate (but guest posters are welcome). As you probably figured, it will focus on all things related to Economy and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics" target="_blank">Economics</a>. I have been fascinated by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics" target="_blank">Economics</a> as a science for a while now, and I find it especially amazing that even in this day and age with all the research that was done, Reality often drifts away from our Economist predictions.
    </div>

  * <div align="justify">
      I am also taking affirmative action on few other project of mine, but I am not prepared to talk about those just yet. Details sure to follow, I promise.
    </div>

<p align="justify">
  So, have a great new year! I will continue to update my <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/18433100766597525188" target="_blank">Shared Deals & Blogs</a> (on the right column here) multiple times each day with the latest bargains and major tech developments and news. I also hope to bring you more tips about technology and, of course, life in general.
</p>

<p align="justify">
