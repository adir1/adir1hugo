First, I am glad that I am on e-billing, although I don&#8217;t have an iPhone yet.  
Second, I am sure [we][1] had to work hard to produce such a huge bill ðŸ˜‰  
Third, I wonder if [AT&T][2] will consider modifying bill format or otherwise amending customer agreement to avoid needing to send this calamity, especially on mostly Unlimited plan!!!
