I decided to add some widgets from [yourminis][1] to my blog, but Alas, it isn&#8217;t nearly as simple as it should be. I consider myself pretty web savvy, but configuring the embed script that it generates is been nothing but trouble. Most of ones I tried are too wide for my sidebar, and resizing them breaks most of them, sad sad times&#8230;

I tried embedding simple youtube yourminis widget below, but although it showed videos, you couldn&#8217;t click to watch any of them&#8230; So, I replaced it with this direct [youtube][2] video instead. Of course, embedding from youtube took about 10 seconds and worked flawlessly. Enjoy!

I&#8217;m sorry to hear about your poor experience with yourminis. Actually, YouTube changed something on their end which caused our widget to break &#8211; obviously their own player continued to work. We have made a fix for this change and now our widget will play the YouTube videos &#8211; with the benefit of having more than one video embedded into the widget. As for the sidebar, we make do our best to make the widgets resizeable, just for that purpose. Unfortunately, sometimes our smallest size just isn&#8217;t small enough. We&#8217;ll continue to improve over time&#8230;

Thanks for follow-up, thats great to hear!

I will definitely give them another try in the future, I do wish there were a visual tutorial to explain how to properly use yourminis, though.
