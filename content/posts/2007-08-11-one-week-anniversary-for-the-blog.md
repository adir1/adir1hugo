First, I promise not to celebrate each week in the future ðŸ™‚ , but I think the first week was so thrilling that it&#8217;s worth writing about.

Lets start with words on the platform itself, which is <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a>. I actually tried Drupal first, but found it too cumbersome for just managing simple blog. WordPress was simple to install and extend. I ran into some issues with some widgets, but overall, it&#8217;s excellent and very recommended.

In other news, my About and Ventures pages are still not ready, but I did get started there, some&#8230;

I do have lots of subjects to post about, and decided to try and move About this Blog into the About page, unusual, yes?

I am especially happy with the way Google Reader Shared items now automatically show up on my right column, many thanks to <a href="http://nothingoutoftheordinary.com" target="_blank">James Wilson</a> for this excellent widget. I can automatically publish interesting articles from anywhere with Google reader, which includes my Cell phone and Blackberry, of course. Watch that spot for articles of interest, or subscribe to my <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/AdisSharedItems" target="_blank">Google Reader Shared</a> links directly.

I did have to do minor customization to widgets and CSS style, just to improve how it looks, to my taste. It isn&#8217;t easy some times to find proper spot in huge PHP intertwined framework like WordPress, where each part of page coming from. But, once you do, I find PHP to be very flexible, powerful and fun to use.

Coming up next, posts about <a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.escapepod.org" target="_blank">EscapePod</a> (and other excellent Podcasts), and <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com" target="_blank">World of Warcraft</a>, among other things.
