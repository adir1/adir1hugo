  I am still here! The family and I went through a rough patch of little winter stomach virus, but I think we&#8217;re about climbing out of it. I have few interesting articles that are in the works!

  Meanwhile, check out this innovative <a href="http://www.spacetime.com/" target="_blank">3D browser</a> of sorts. It is <strong>Not</strong> Virtual Reality (aka VRML) or anything like that, but it does organize your 2D pages and search results in 3D space and on an almost useful timeline.

  Overall, probably more of an Awe factor than real useful, just yet. Still, if you splurged on that super-dupper Vista PC and still can&#8217;t figure out exactly what is so super in it, download and try this thing. It&#8217;s sure to WoW your friends and your parents.

  It is called <a href="http://www.spacetime.com/" target="_blank">SpaceTime</a> and it is a sign of better things to come, courtesy of Windows Vista technology.
