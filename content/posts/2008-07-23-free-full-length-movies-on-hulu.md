**UPDATE (Jun 2009):** Hulu.com took down most of these excellent movies, and replaced with (\*expletive censored\*). So I had to come up with [a new list of recommendations][1].

<p align="justify">
  I just came across some excellent full length movies on Hulu, that appear to be available to everyone (in USA probably) completely free and legally! Here are some examples:
</p>

  * <div align="justify">
      <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/26116/the-fifth-element" target="_blank">The Fifth Element</a> &#8211; one of my most favorite movies of all time! Adventure and Sci-Fi comes together in perfect Art Form.
    </div>
    
      * <div align="justify">
          <a href="http://www.hulu.com/jerry-maguire">Jerry Maguire</a> &#8211; Call it Love Story, call it Business Primer or just call it &#8211; Classic
        </div>
        
          * <div align="justify">
              <a title="http://www.hulu.com/titan-ae" href="http://www.hulu.com/titan-ae">Titan A.E.</a> &#8211; Excellent animated feature, another fun Sci-Fi adventure
            </div>
            
              * <div align="justify">
                  <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/25939/underworld-evolution" target="_blank"></a>Underworld: Evolution</a> &#8211; movie is available, maybe they are starting a trend and will keep adding movies<a href="http://www.hulu.com/the-girl-next-door" target="_blank"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="184" alt="The Girl Next Door" src="/uploads/2008/07/The Girl Next Door Web.jpg" width="144" align="right" border="0" /></a>
                </div>
                
                  * <div align="justify">
                      <a href="http://www.hulu.com/men-in-black">Men in Black</a> &#8211; There is no such thing as &#8220;Too Much Sci-Fi&#8221;!!
                    </div>
                    
                      * <div align="justify">
                          <a href="http://www.hulu.com/requiem-for-a-dream">Requiem for a Dream</a> &#8211; Powerful and Moving experience, very well directed. Sit down your teenager in front of this one, for best Anti-Drug message available anywhere.
                        </div>
                        
                          * <div align="justify">
                              <a href="http://www.hulu.com/ghostbusters">Ghostbusters</a> &#8211; Need I say more?
                            </div>
                            
                              * <div align="justify">
                                  <a href="http://www.hulu.com/the-girl-next-door">The Girl Next Door</a> &#8211; What!!? I am a Guy, right? Besides, it&#8217;s funny, sometimes! ðŸ˜‰
                                </div></ul> 
                            
                            <p align="justify">
                              I had no idea they offered full length movies, and it was especially pleasant to see these new favorites alongside old classics. There was even something for kids, but I&#8217;ll just let you browse the entire collection for yourselves:
                            </p>
                            
                            <p align="justify">
                              <a href="http://www.hulu.com/browse/alphabetical/feature_films">Hulu Full Length Movies Collection</a> &#8211; Enjoy!
                            </p>

You mean no Hulu.com ? Do you live in United States? It doesn&#8217;t work anywhere else.  
Also, make sure your Flash is working right, search my blog about how to fix Flash troubles.
