Along with a new name, it got a grand redesign, which I like. 

It is currently my High Definition Internet Video aggregator of choice, along with old time favorite <a href="http://www.allpvr.com/to-vuze-or-not-to-vuze-zat-is-ze-queszion/" target="_blank">Vuze</a>, of course.

<a href="http://www.getmiro.com/" target="_blank">Miro</a> is a Free and Open-Source media player and aggregator. It collects RSS feeds (called Channels&nbsp;in Miro), has it&#8217;s own handy guide of channels and uses Peer to Peer technology to speed up downloads, what more can you ask for?

You can adjust each channel to either automatically download new shows, or just&nbsp;tell you about new shows and let you decide what to download. It also manages disk space by automatically removing old videos, after certain period of time (like a month or so) or if you are running low on space.

I also love it because of it&#8217;s amazing video playback capabilities. You can configure it to see your local video files and so far it was able to play back everything and anything I threw at it, including H.264, flv, quicktime and the good old DivX/Xvid files.

Though, personally I don&#8217;t see any need for that.

My favorite channels on Miro right now are Timo&#8217;s Movie Trailer channel and InDigital HD. dl.tv is also among the best, and I like to be able to catch up on news via my PC and subscription to CNN In Case You missed It channel on <a href="http://www.getmiro.com/" target="_blank">Miro</a>.

So, give it a <a href="http://www.getmiro.com/" target="_blank">try for your self</a>.</p>
