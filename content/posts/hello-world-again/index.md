I am Back!!! After unfathomably long hiatus - I now promise to post Much more often.

Writing about Life, Technology and The Universe!

As you notice, the site is vastly improved! I was eyeing [JamStack](https://jamstack.org/) for several years, but it is such a major departure from WordPress architecture, that I was hesitant. The process was every bit as painful as I thought, but it is Worth It! Initially I tried to use Gatsby, but I couldn't find theme to my liking. So I continued the search and ended up with Hugo, and amazing [Blowfish](https://nunocoracao.github.io/blowfish/) theme.

A quick recap of the years since the last post:

- I had (further) awakening in Nov 2019, just as pandemic was gearing up, more on that in future posts.
- Loving Family Life! And technology that captures it all and helps us make memories! What a Time To Be Alive!
- Consciousness, Aliens, Angels, Demons - trying to study that whole dimension that prefers to stay hidden.

I also learned that people these days prefer Short posts - so I'll try to wrap this up with today's wisdom

Here's a link to the original First Hello World post on this site, back in 2003!
