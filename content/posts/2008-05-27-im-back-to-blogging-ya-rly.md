I have so many excuses, but the truth is, I think I got &#8220;afraid&#8221; somehow. The more people know and read my blog, especially of those people who know me personally, the more I got worried about being judged based on the posts I write.

I decided to try and be braver! Ummm, but not today, not just yet.. ðŸ˜‰

  Instead, Today I bring you fun sites to check out, that really impressed me! Starting off with <a href="http://www.taggalaxy.de/" target="_blank">Tag Galaxy</a>, which I shared on my new and improved <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/18433100766597525188" target="_blank">Shared Items feed</a>. It links into an amazing database of tagged photos that is <a href="http://www.flickr.com" target="_blank">Flickr</a>, and then leverages the relationships between the tags to create an amazing Planet like view of photographic awesomeness.

Check out this excellent <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24207533" target="_blank">MSNBC&#8217;s Spectra news visualizer</a>.

  Oh, and the whole &#8220;Ya Rly&#8221; thing is from <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com" target="_blank">WoW</a>, which is still where I&#8217;m spending way too much time, really&#8230;
