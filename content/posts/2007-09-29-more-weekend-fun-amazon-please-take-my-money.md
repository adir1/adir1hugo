Enjoy a little break from the geekyness of this blog. This is one of the latest [Hilary Duff][1]<img style="margin: 0px; border-top-style: none! important; border-right-style: none! important; border-left-style: none! important; border-bottom-style: none! important" height="1" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=craftonia-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" border="0" /> videos, and it seems to be her most adult style ever, which is great by me ðŸ˜‰

Speaking of music, I went to Amazon to try to purchase from their new MP3 store some of the music, both old and new, that is on my "to buy" list. To my disappointment, I was unable to find Any of it. 

While their MP3 store has excellent promise, I really wish it had more selection. I hope it is just a matter of time as more artists/labels sign up for this revolution. So, Amazon did not take any of my money, but I will try to be patient ðŸ™‚
