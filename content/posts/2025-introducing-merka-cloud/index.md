## Overview

Part 3 of Next Programming Revolution series, reinventing distributing computing! Jump to [Part 1](/2025/the-next-programming-revolution/) and then come back here.
What does it take to Rethink distributed computing - notice I didn't say Cloud computing, Merka aims to include your own (or company owned) devices as a First-Class citizens. The goal is to utilize your available compute/storage efficiently, and also avoiding the all too familiar "where did I leave that?..." syndrome.

## Elevator Pitch

Merka.Cloud is your personal (and business) cloud combining storage, compute, applications and includes built-in AI assistant to manage it all for you! It combines your own devices and hosted services to achieve fully-featured yet cost-effective hybrid cloud - without all the complexity! The goal is not just to transparently manage large volume of data, images, videos, and more, but also to do it very efficiently.

## The Declarative Age

At the core of the design is Declarative approach combined with AI, backed by distributed/versioned file system. The stack star feature is AI Agents platform, ensuring there are agents that can help with both managing your Cloud, and helping you with your day to day needs. On top of all this we add auto-deployable software applications, leveraging same SSO solution and ultimately utilizing AI to bridge their input/output into the rest of the Merka cloud ecosystem.

And no, there are no plans to have Merka.Cloud CLI - Seriously, what is it with Everyone developing Yet Another CLI these days? I would like to advocate for replacement of CLI with Chat interface - just discuss your needs in conversational language and have AI Agent(s) execute it for you!

## Open-Source

I am deeply inspired by the open-source revolution unfolding before us. Every day, GitHub contributions to key components surge, fueling an ecosystem where modular collaboration sparks even more powerful open-source solutions. For me, there was never a doubt - this project had to be fully open-source. It stands on the shoulders of leading open modules, and my vision is to enable seamless integration of countless more in the future.

## Summary

At the moment the idea is but a seed, yet full of amazing potential. With the right ingredients, it can grow into something extraordinary. Will you join me in nurturing it into a groundbreaking Open-Source platform that could change everything?!
