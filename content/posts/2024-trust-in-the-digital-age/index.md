## TLDR



## Notes

Trust is important, who do we trust? We trust family, but that leads to nepotism. How is Identity defined and tracked on the Internet? Email ownership? Domain Ownership? 
Countries track people with digital and non-digital IDs - birth certificate, parent attestation? What about cancel culture - what if you were mislead, or what if it is a lie.
Historians, Books, Wikipedia, Facts are even fluid
AI Website to track facts - different points of view need exploring - many things can be true at the same time
Lies even from parents to children, lies to historians, political corruption, power seeking, elections
Governance - Elections integrity, who can vote, how is it assured and secured
Property trust chain, property ownership, creating value for society, moneyless society
