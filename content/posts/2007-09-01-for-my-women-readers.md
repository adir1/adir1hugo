Linking to Porn is a sure way to get lots of hits, right? But, most porn is really guy oriented, so I was happy to come across some <a href="http://www.feelingflirty.com/porn-for-women-what-women-find-sexy/" target="_blank">Porn specifically for Women</a>!

Don&#8217;t worry, it is <a href="http://www.feelingflirty.com/porn-for-women-what-women-find-sexy/" target="_blank">guaranteed to work</a>, while still being Work Safe! Amazing!

Enjoy!
