<a href="http://www.dellideastorm.com" target="_blank">Dell&#8217;s IdeaStorm</a> has a simple, yet powerful, concept. People (presumably Dell users and buyers) submit Ideas of what they would like to see improved/added/changed in Dell&#8217;s Products/Support/Services.

Other people vote ideas (<a href="http://www.digg.com" target="_blank">Digg</a> style) Up and Down. After voting, Popular ideas which got voted high enough, get reviewed by Dell management (again, presumably) and discussed in an effort to ultimately please their customers.

Today, I submitted my first Idea there, which I think most people will agree with (it&#8217;s already getting promoted). I think you will agree as well, so help out a <a href="http://www.dellideastorm.com/article/show/72940/Add_Windows_Vista_Premium_option_for_Vostro_Line" target="_blank">good idea</a>!

I won&#8217;t repeat things here, as everything is <a href="http://www.dellideastorm.com/article/show/72940/Add_Windows_Vista_Premium_option_for_Vostro_Line" target="_blank">explained in my Idea post</a>.</p>
