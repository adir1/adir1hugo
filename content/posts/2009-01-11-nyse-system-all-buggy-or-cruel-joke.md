Actually, I am not laying any blame, but <a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?q=amd" target="_blank">Google Finance</a> and <a href="http://moneycentral.msn.com/detail/stock_quote?Symbol=amd" target="_blank">MSN Money</a> <u>both</u> show a quote of 28.67 for AMD (<a href="http://www.nyse.com/about/listed/lcddata.html?ticker=AMD" target="_blank">NYSE:AMD</a>), which translates into an increase of <strong>946%</strong> – <strong>Overnight</strong>!! Meanwhile, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=amd" target="_blank">Yahoo Finance</a> is still correct!
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Actually, on the NYSE web site itself the quote seems correct, but looks like whatever feeding many other systems is messed up! And this is not the only quote, I found many others to be strange and incorrect!!! Some showing down 95% overnight, others up, and so forth, all over the place. Not clear if those prices are something from history of few years back, or just random glitch…

  Makes you wonder, how safe is our financial system? Hopefully this is no hacker, but just a small bug, we all know those happen, and fortunately today is not a trading day!

  <strong><u>UPDATE</u></strong>: OMG!!! While I was typing, it already got fixed! KUDOS (though we are still worried)! I have Photographic Evidence above! I checked several others that were broken, they appear fine also now… Hmmm…
</p>

<p align="justify">
  <strong><u>UPDATE2</u></strong>: For proof that I am not crazy, look closely at Google intra-day chart (comes up by default, or click on 5d). Look at Jan 10, it shows some fluctuations of AMD stock (for example) with stock in $26 range, and moving in price – STRANGE!

That&#8217;s why I do testing and am still in business :)Actually, that&#8217;s not the first one for NYSE &#8211; if you remember, a couple of years ago they had the &#8220;worst day ever&#8221; that was a result of a software problem, at least partially. The excessive trading resulted in performance issues that triggered&#8230; and so on.
