  Apologies to all my International blog readers. This is an official Simpsons episode, and I think it only is watchable inside the US right now. I am certain if you do a quick YouTube search, or <a href="http://www.veoh.com/search.html?type=v&#038;search=Mypods+and+Broomsticks">Veoh</a>, etc, you will find another openly available copy.

  So, <a href="http://imapc.lifewithoutwalls.com/">are you a PC</a>? I am, though I own and enjoy iPhone also. I think for me the price premium is the deal breaker for Mac, plus I do like to tinker and upgrade my computers ALL THE TIME!
