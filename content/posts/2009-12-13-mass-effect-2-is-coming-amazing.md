I was holding out to play Mass Effect one for the longest time, until I finally picked it up via [Steam][1] a month or so ago. I must say, I thoroughly enjoyed it! Classic Sci-Fi adventure game with artful combat system. Story line was short, but interesting. Yes, I did get to [famous sex scene][2], and found it to be very tasteful, much more so than one may see on occasion on broadcast TV.  
So, I am one of many now looking forward to upcoming release of [Mass Effect 2][3]. This recently released sneak peak of voices and stars behind Mass Effect 2 shows you how much of a movie-like production it has become. In my mind, the fact that you get to play main character inside this vast universe of stars (pun intended) is a grand bonus that soon will be a must for most people:
