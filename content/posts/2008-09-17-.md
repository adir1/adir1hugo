Zune 3 is here, and here is an honest user comparison with iPod Touch, which I count as my iPhone being equivalent to for the purposes of this review.

&#8211; Audible and OverDrive is awesome! DRM&#8217;d material (ew), but at least I can get it to-go on my Zune, check your local library!

Games! iPod Touch is still better gaming platform, but I think very few people buy that device for gaming anyhow.. Nice of Zune to add gaming, so echosystem of games for Zune can still grow significantly
