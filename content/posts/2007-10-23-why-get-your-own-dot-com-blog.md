  When I launched this site, several months ago, <a href="http://zheka1.livejournal.com/" target="_blank">a good friend</a> asked me why would I bother the expense, the time and the complexity of having my own separate Dot Com blog, when there are so many other web sites out there for blogging these days.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Well, here&#8217;s a perfect example why: Yahoo! 360, home of my <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-A9lS5Qswf69HhOZ8ug--;_ylt=AopjH7a41Qer2aMteukULiK0AOJ3?cq=1" target="_blank">earlier blog</a>, is being &#8220;<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/174005609/" target="_blank">turned off</a>&#8220;. Yes, they are promising to keep our content, although at this time they aren&#8217;t sure on what site or in which form&#8230;
</p>

<p align="justify">
  <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.adir1.com//uploads/2007/10/yahoo360-logo.png?resize=214%2C42" id="id" style="border: 0px none " alt="yahoo360-logo" align="left" border="0" height="42" width="214" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Actually, I trust <a href="http://www.yahoo.com" target="_blank">Yahoo!</a> and I think they are doing the right thing. I wouldn&#8217;t have created my blog there in the first place if I did not have full trust in them (Full disclosure: I own some <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=YHOO" target="_blank">Yahoo! stock</a>). They are going through some management turmoil now, and these are rough times while many leading tech companies (Microsoft comes to mind!) trying to figure out what works and what doesn&#8217;t, and what is the best model for the future of computing for masses.

  So, back to the issue at hand. When this blog launched, I actually used another Web Host. Since I own my domain, it took only about half an hour to completely move my blog with All Its Content to a <a href="http://www.adir1.com/2007/08/the-new-host-awaits/" title="ASmallOrange.com" target="_blank">new provider</a>. And the best thing, my readers did not feel a thing. I still have the same address in the vastness of the Internet, which is very important.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  By the way, same thing goes for email! In this day and age I am just shocked when I hear anyone using their Internet Provider email address. What is this <a href="mailto:qtpie@comcast.nt">qtpie@comcast.nÃ«t</a> email you are giving out to people??? What will you do when you change to DSL provider next year? Or move to a state without Comcast? Why loose your email identity, your connection to friends? Why not utilize <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com" target="_blank">Yahoo! Mail</a> or <a href="http://mail.google.com/" target="_blank">GMail</a> or <a href="http://www.hotmail.com" target="_blank">Hotmail</a> (by Microsoft), which are all free!
</p>

  If you are still reading this long post, then here are some things useful for you. Probably, one of the easiest options to get your own .Com with Blog going these days is provided by <a href="http://www.wordpress.com" target="_blank">WordPress.com</a>. For a little extra pay you can even <a href="http://faq.wordpress.com/2006/11/10/domain-mapping/" target="_blank">point your actual .Com</a> domain there, giving you a complete solution. If you are more adventurous and feel comfortable with uploading PHP sources and creating MySql databases, check out complete Open Source solutions from <a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress.org</a> or <a href="http://movabletype.org/" target="_blank">MovableType.org</a> .
