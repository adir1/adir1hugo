## TLDR

Netflix again cancelled several of our favorite shows, me and the family are Fuming! In this post I set out to explore Netflix decision process and show the myriad of major flaws in it. At the end I offer some solution ideas, because I like to improve things, not just complain about things.

## Netflix CEO Lying (to himself)

In a recent Interview for Bloomberg, Netflix new co-CEOs made a bold statement that "they never cancel a successful show". This statement quickly catapulted to the top of the news by itself, simply because most of Netflix subscribers vehemently disagree with it! In our household this is a common occurrence as well - supporting each other as we hear the devastating news of yet another cancellation.

Most recently my 10 year old had this experience for the first time also, as I had to let him know that his favorite Dead End: Paranormal Park got axed. There were a lot of tears and screams of "Why!?", so I set out to explore this a detail. Specifically, how can it be that Netflix, which is (arguably) at the forefront of Big Data Analytics and "Data Driven Decisions", can get this so wrong?
 
And above all this - they keep Cancelled shows on their site WITHOUT NOTICE not to expect more seasons!

## Big Data Is Hard

## Solution Ideas


Outline
- New shows probably get disproportionally axed, often by virtue of being unkown - Taste the new food?
- Customers get emotionally invested, and will tend to refuse to get emotionally invested in the future. Fool Me Once, Fool Me Twice.
- CEO proclamation shows us how misguided the organization is, based on bad big data
- Collecting data is hard, and wrong (Chromecast, Multiple People sometimes under same profile, other factors)
- Analyzing data is harder - how we decide
- Solution: Here's a hint, minimize assumptions, actually ask proper question to get proper answer
- Solution: Stop making shows altogether? Movie Series - Ala BOND
