  I‚Äôm back, and just posting quick update on little ‚Äúbig‚Äù things that are going on with me. Filing this one under ‚ÄúRandom Thoughts‚Äù, FYI.

  <a href="http://moneycentral.msn.com/home.asp" target="_blank"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="MSN Money Logo" border="0" alt="MSN Money Logo" align="left" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.adir1.com/uploads/2009/06/msnmoneylogo.jpg?resize=205%2C50" width="205" height="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Microsoft announced officially last week that they are discontinuing Microsoft Money product. This Really saddened me, frankly. Something in the way they presented it made me especially sad. I was always expecting MS-Money desktop software to die, and to be replaced by cloud based solution (like <a href="http://www.quicken.com/" target="_blank">Quicken.com</a> and <a href="http://moneycentral.msn.com/" target="_blank">MSN Money</a>). But instead of telling us to use Web solution, they just told us to ‚ÄúGo Away‚Äù‚Ä¶

  Worse yet, I have been buying Home & Business edition for many years, to manage our small business, using their wonderful inventory management tools and invoices, etc. What replaces this? Nothing, really‚Ä¶ Only super expensive and complex accounting packages, which I really hate (and don‚Äôt need for our tiny business)!!!

  <img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="iPhone 3G S video editing" border="0" alt="iPhone 3G S video editing" align="right" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.adir1.com/uploads/2009/06/iphone3gsvideoediting.jpg?resize=240%2C139" width="240" height="139" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Ok, onto next rant‚Ä¶ iPhone 3.0 came out, just installed it today. Where is my Video!? I really expected them to provide some video capture support for older handsets. Seriously, I don‚Äôt need fancy video editing in-phone, but I should be able to capture low-resolution clips!!! Phones with far lesser CPU were able to do this easily for years ‚Äì Apple, I didn‚Äôt expect this level of incompetence, seriously! I am looking forward to finally be alerted if someone is trying to IM me on Yahoo Messenger or ICQ, etc. I hope it works, as finally latest OS should allow it, but don‚Äôt know which Apps implemented this yet‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll report on this later.

  Final rant of the evening is about email and Twitter. I had a case in the office recently, someone replying to an email with ‚Äúscreenshot‚Äù of the issue. All he wrote was ‚ÄúI will check into it‚Äù. This resulted in 500KB+ email being blasted to hundreds of people by poor Microsoft Exchange server (and poor people who have to keep cleaning their mailboxes). Ridiculous! We need a better email system, and at least publically Twitter does some of that. Needs more evolution, but exchange Must Die and quick. We must figure out a better way to communicate, both inside the Enterprise and over public Internet. Well, I can blog my ideas on this in the future, if there is interest (hint, post comments!)

  There, Rant Done! I‚Äôll try to come back to regular insightful blogging in the near future üôÇ

  Meanwhile, I leave you with MORE RANT! Windows 7 64 Bit Release Candidate STILL doesn‚Äôt install on my main PC. No love for me, very sad‚Ä¶ Thinking of replacing my Motherboard or something, but it‚Äôs annoying to go through all that trouble and expense‚Ä¶
