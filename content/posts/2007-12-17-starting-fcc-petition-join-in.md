  <a href="http://www.fcc.gov" target="_blank">FCC</a> hasn&#8217;t been doing it&#8217;s job in regulating our home TV delivery choices! Seriously, so many years later and we still have no a-la-carte channels! But, this post is Future, not past&#8230;
</p>

<p align="justify">
  I recently became aware that Cable transmits most of their digital channels, both HD and regular, in encrypted QAM transmission. Now, I respect Cable companies&#8217; right to encrypt their digital channels which they are offering beyond the mandated "local" choices, but Why Encrypt the LOCAL channels!?
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Right now there is no law stating that HD re-transmission of local channels over Cable, done in QAM, must be in ClearQAM (non-encrypted kind). So, they are free to encrypt those local channels in HD, just to force people to upgrade even when all they want is LOCAL Channels.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  This becomes even more critical issue as more local channels switch to HD, and as Analog TV is phased out. All those shiny new LCD / Plasma HD TVs you buy today come with built-in QAM tuner. BUT, it&#8217;s useless if Cable encrypt the local channels!
</p>

<p align="justify">
  So, FCC, don&#8217;t wait while more and more people are forced to switch by deceiving cable companies (who now also claim that they are "forced" to switch Off Analog cable, deceiving public, because the mandate is only for over-the-air transmission)! Get to work Now!

PS: I am sorry for slow posting lately. I am working on 2 big posts coming soon, promise!

This web site is based on excellent Open Source platform from WordPress.org, so it&#8217;s them who did most of the hard work!  
But, thank you for positive feedback, and I will make sure to spend more time with family (that&#8217;s why my blogging is a bit behind!) ðŸ™‚
