<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/programs/" target="_blank"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="70" alt="Nova Logo" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.adir1.com//uploads/2008/01/nova-logo.jpg?resize=172%2C70" width="172" align="left" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> I was wondering when PBS will jump on the web bandwagon and offer their shows on-demand via the Internet.

<p align="justify">
  I checked again today, and looks like their library is growing nicely. It used to be just one or two shows available last time I checked, but library is <a href="http://www.pbs.org/video/?campaign=pbshomepage_videoagg_link" target="_blank">much bigger now</a>.

  But, what was most thrilling is that finally majority of Nova programs are available online, in full length and decent quality glory! Looks like video web delivery was tough for the team, but maybe it&#8217;s for the best, as you should be able to download the shows, if you&#8217;re so inclined.

A lot of interesting things to learn, presented in popular fashion. So, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/programs/" target="_blank">check it out</a>. I decided that this is even worthy a small entry on my videos page, for later reference.</p>
