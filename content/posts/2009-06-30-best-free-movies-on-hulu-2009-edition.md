  I noticed that they took down Most of the movies I <a href="http://www.adir1.com/2008/07/free-full-length-movies-on-hulu/" target="_blank">liked on Hulu</a> as my recommendations, a year ago. Only Girl Next Door remains, which brings up a thought of a Chicken-n-Egg situation. Specifically â€“ Do they put Young Guy attracting movies because that is their demographics, or is their demographics this way <em>because</em> they put Young Guy attracting movies?

  But, you are not here for brain teasers, are you. So, no fear, as I set out to compile my latest time-killers list of Favorites, to satisfy your fancy (if your taste is anything like mine, that is). Again, available only in USA (most likely). Voila:
</p>

  * Action: <a href="http://www.hulu.com/air-force-one-tv" target="_blank">Air Force One</a> â€“ Great suspense, well executed all around
  * Drama: <a href="http://www.hulu.com/fatal-attraction" target="_blank">Fatal Attraction</a> â€“ Borderline drama, thriller, and will help ensure that you never date again
  * Sci-Fi: <a href="http://www.hulu.com/virtuality" target="_blank">Virtuality</a> â€“ Something new, made for TV, but heck, why notâ€¦<a href="http://www.hulu.com/virtuality" target="_blank"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px 0px 5px 10px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Virtuality Movie" border="0" alt="Virtuality Movie" align="right" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.adir1.com/uploads/2009/06/virtualitymovie.png?resize=150%2C85" width="150" height="85" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> 
  * Science Documentary: <a href="http://www.hulu.com/cosmic-voyage" target="_blank">Cosmic Voyage</a> â€“ Well spent 36 minutes, if it is that time of day when you brain still works
  * Independent: <a href="http://www.hulu.com/gamebox-10" target="_blank">Gamebox 1.0</a> â€“ Iâ€™ll admit it, I havenâ€™t watched the movie, but reviews look promising!
  * Kids and Family (free babysitter! ðŸ˜‰ ) â€“ <a href="http://www.hulu.com/anastasia" target="_blank">Anastasia</a> â€“ Even has a bit of historical authenticity to it

  Frankly, the quality of movies is drastically lower than it was a year ago. I think their lack-of-revenue is showing. Of course you can always try crowdsourcing the task of choosing <a href="http://www.hulu.com/popular/feature_films/this_month?h=21" target="_blank">the best movie</a> for you (but see warning from paragraph one above).
</p>

Better yet, hit their excellent <a href="http://www.hulu.com/tv" target="_blank">TV shows</a> selection, which is still very decent. Enjoy!
