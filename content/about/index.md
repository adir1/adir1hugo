## About This Blog

This is my thoughts blog, and as such it is a hybrid between Technology and Software Industry insights and The Meaning of Life revelations. You will **not** see cute kitties in this blog, simply because they aren’t in my thoughts, ever. Instead you should **expect to encounter** different kind of fun things here, like gaming, gadgets and more!

## About Me

During daytime, I work as a Software Architect at [Amdocs](https://www.amdocs.com) (since 2022 in our [Vubiquity](https://www.vubiquity.com) division), building for our great clients. After hours I am a self-proclaimed technology guru who loves computing, gadgets and gaming. I constantly try to stay up-to-date with the latest technology and science breakthroughs and often venture to try experimental stuff on my own time. I will try to post about such adventures as well, and explore together to find the Next Big Thing.

I love my family, and I value their privacy. Thus I won’t share much of personal family stuff here. If you know me personally, feel free to connect via [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/adir1) – I am posting a lot there. I am also on [Geni](https://www.geni.com), which is a great site for families to stay in touch and share photos and latest news.

If you prefer, you can email me directly. I got adi **email** on this blog (yes, it is adi at adir1 dot (you know it, but spammers don’t)). I promise to review all incoming email, and respond if warranted.
