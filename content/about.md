About This Blog
---------------

[![Adi Rabinovich's Facebook profile](https://i0.wp.com/badge.facebook.com/badge/697541586.137.850817646.png?resize=32%2C32)](https://www.facebook.com/adir1) This is my thoughts blog, and as such it is a hybrid between Technology and Software Industry insights and The Meaning of Life revelations. You will **not** see cute kitties in this blog, simply because they aren’t in my thoughts, ever. Instead you should **expect to encounter** different kind of fun things here, like gaming, gadgets and more!

About Me
--------

During daytime, I work as a Software Architect from [Amdocs](https://www.amdocs.com) for our great clients. After hours I am a self-proclaimed technology guru who loves computing, gadgets and gaming. [![View Adi Rabinovich's profile on LinkedIn](https://i2.wp.com/www.linkedin.com/img/webpromo/btn_myprofile_160x33.gif?resize=160%2C33)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adir1)I constantly try to stay up-to-date with the latest technology and breakthroughs and often venture to try experimental stuff on my own time. I will try to post about such adventures as well, and explore together to find the Next Big Thing.

I love my family, and I value their privacy. Thus I won’t share much of personal family stuff here. If you know me, feel free to connect via [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/adir1) – I am posting a lot there. I am also on [Geni](https://www.geni.com), which is a great site for families to stay in touch and share photos and latest news.

The easiest way to **Contact Me** is to leave a comment on any of the posts. I promptly review each comment and make every effort to respond. Or, if you prefer, email me directly. I got adi **email** on this blog (yes, it is adi at adir1 dot (you know it, but spammers don’t)). I promise to review all incoming email, and respond if warranted.
